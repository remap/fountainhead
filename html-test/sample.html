    <p class='action'>(A Traveler, RACHEL, is in the room, texting or playing or on her mobile devise obsessively. Electromechanical sounds are heard off-stage, via SND-T*. They might seem to be related to Rachel’s obsessive activity.  She pauses and then hits a button hard- the sound of rain  begins nearby. A LONG BEAT and then a distant pinging sound off-stage.  The sign updates: “Date of Transfer Event: <<Thursday, June 1, 2026>>. Time: << + 00 Days, 00 Hours, 00 Minutes”>>.  )</p>

    <p class='character rachel onliners'>RACHEL</p>
    <p class='dialogue onliners'>When I was a girl. I had dreams. Strange dreams. I had so many things to think about that my mind would always wander when I shut my eyelids. I dreamt with colors and animals and newborn babies crawling. I dreamt of big sky and highways and family vacations. Dreams about old flames and new fire. I dreamt of Rottweilers in heat. I had dreams. Good and bad. I was able to remember some well. Others not so much. Back then, everyone had dreams. <em>Everyone* had things going on. Happening. Events occurred. Now I can’t remember. Now we’re stuck here in this...this *wasteland</em>.</p>
    <p class='action'>(A louder ping, closer. )</p>

    <p class='scene-heading'>SCENE 2 (RACHEL DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE)</p>
    <p class='action'>(Rachel walks down a passage way and the stops, she picks up an umbrella and opens it. The sound of rain, the memory of rain- there is not actual rain. Rachel continues walking through the tunnel and addressing her new friend.)</p>
    <p class='character rachel onliners'>RACHEL</p>
    <p class='dialogue onliners'>Once upon a time...it used to rain once in a while . Now it’s like a desert out there When was the last time it rained? Do you remember? Now there’s nothing left except hot days and  the grey whirl of machinery (???) and another day gone by. Back then we had rain and angels. We had a city and a place to call home. Now everything is one giant collage. There are no boundaries. No neighborhoods. Only endless information. We float. We drift in a sea of regret. I am lost without memory and CONNECTION</p>
    <p class='action'>(She continues making sure the audience follows. The Fans can continue to watch on the Web via the Fan Site, or browse the Archive. )</p>
    <p class='scene-heading'>SCENE 3 : DRINK ME (RACHEL FURTHER DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE)</p>
    <p class='action'>(A narrow tunnel, littered with objects and memories. Dimly lit with a pulsing light as if from the sign (SGN-A`   *) of the previous room. )</p>
    <p class='action'>(RACHEL can’t see. She stops suddenly and points. A Candidate finds a small flashlight labeled “ TURN ME ON” and gives it to her.  Sh e turns it on and the walls flicker a bit brighter and seem to quiver. In the distance is a faint buzzing sound of machinery (via SND-AG*) They move towards it. As they get closer it resolves into the overlapping voices of thousands of recorded phone calls.)</p>
    <p class='action'>(She speaks FAST GROWING excited.)</p>
    <p class='character rachel onliners'>RACHEL</p>
    <p class='dialogue onliners'>Pizza. Pasta. Salad with bread. Tortillas. Mole. Arroz con Leche. Cookies. Candy. Lots of candy. Cereal and Cranberry Juice. Pan Dulce. I’m hungry. I’m so hungry I could eat a Horse or a goat. Or a dead dog with enough meat on its bones. I haven’t had meat in ages. I haven’t had anything green in years it seems like. Everything kinda withered or disappeared but now? Now I <em>feel* it. I feel my tongue get wet and start to shiver. It needs food. Real food. Maybe an apple or a carrot or a. ( SHE TRIES TO DESCRIBE IT)...A *mango*. Yeah. I will eat fruit and then get healthy enough to go back home. If I can remember where it is? I’m *starving</em>. I’m hungry. Hungry for the sensation in my throat when I speak out loud, the feeling of warmth I get when I read, the short lived bliss I’m in when I fuck and we fall asleep together- but with who?  I forget. I can sense it but I’ve forgotten what it tastes like. What’s it like to be human? I’ve got the anatomy but I’ve forgotten how to connect. Maybe It starts with food. I need to eat... I need to eat.</p>
    <p class='action'>(Lightning. Darkness. Thunder. Fog. )</p>
    <p class='action'>(Dim lights flicker through the fog. Electromechanical sounds via SND-T*. )</p>
    <p class='action'>(The Archive leaks through. On the walls around the Candidates, via PRJ-T*, the lights become photos, video, brief archival events,  They are clearer than before everyday events that slowly begin to be interwoven with scenes of sterile and decaying views of <<THE CITY>>.  )</p>
    <p class='action'>(The Fans see the same images on the Fan Site but the Candidates are not visible. )</p>
    <p class='action'>(PING! A welcoming sound. The group moves towards the sound. The walls are pulled away, PING! The welomcing sound is louder and closer.  They enter the AGORA)</p>
    <p class='scene-heading'>ACT 2: THE AGORA. SCENE 1: FIRST CONNECTION: REUNION</p>
    <p class='action'>(All the groups of  audience members and their travelers find themselves together in The Agora, bathed in warm and friendly light,  facing five new doors, clear Archival images on the surrounding walls via PRJ-AG*.  )</p>
    <p class='action'>(The growing murmur is now more distinct. The voices of the Citizens can barely be made out, welcoming the GUESTS into the Archive.)</p>
    <p class='action'>THE ARCHIVE</p>
    <p class='action'>(on each Guide, on the web, and as a voice in the Agora)</p>
    <p class='action'>Welcome to Transfer, <<Roshni/Citizen/etc>></p>
    <p class='action'>(The Agora is surrounded by soft FOG drifting through shafts of light. Faint flickering images from the Archive spin around the space, via PRJ-AG*.)</p>
    <p class='action'>THE ARCHIVE</p>
    <p class='action'>(on each Guide)</p>
    <p class='action'>Welcome.</p>
    <p class='action'>(THE Travelers move around the space, point to, comment on, engage the images,encourageing the tourists to do so as well. The audience and performers CAN mix freely in this open space with multiple entrances.)</p>
    <p class='action'>THE ARCHIVE</p>
    <p class='action'>(to the Fans)</p>
    <p class='action'>They have arrived.</p>
    <p class='action'>(For the Fans, a collage/montage of memories of <<THE CITY>> via PRJ-AG<em> that they have never seen before, with paths to follow into the memory of the Archive and, overlaid, live cameras of the physical space (CAM-AG</em>).  )</p>
    <p class='action'>(Each Traveler speaks quietly to those close to them. Perhaps each traveler speaks of a sense; taste, touch, smell, sight based on an image that flashes by and sparks a memory but the memory of these sensations are not enough. They need/want/lack the real thing now. - )</p>
    <p class='action'>RACHEL</p>
    <p class='action'>(aside)</p>
    <p class='action'>When I was a little I would eat. I ate for days. Ice-cream, soda, broccoli and toast. Eggs, bacon, quesadillas, oatmeal, cereal, nachos, and soup. It was perfect. The the heat, The spice, the the sticky,the sweet, the sharing of it all. I was full. We were whole. I need to eat to get back there again. I need to feed this hunger and desire. If only I could find a way to do this. To feed myself something more than electronic obsession.</p>

    <p class='action'>(She moves towards the image. It fades, she sees and moves towards another. The travelers begin to spread out and explore the images throughout the space.
