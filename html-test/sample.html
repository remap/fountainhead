    </com-olf>    <p class='action'>A young woman enters along with the  audience, the Tourists, she is carrying a large purse or backpack distractedly and using her  mobile device. She moves slowly thru the space  stopping  to  punch fiercely at her device and whisper to herself. She seems to be expecting someone, ("Where are you, it's gonna start. You're gonna be late") It begins subtlely and grows in  intensity as the time to enter grows close, at first she  should appear to just be part of the audience. Eventually she stops in the center of the space and drops her bag. A light slowly comes up on this  woman. She is RACHEL a TRAVELER, in the Lobby with the TOURISTS. She appears to be texting or playing or on her mobile device obsessively. The WATCHERS are...watching.</p>
    <p class='action'>Electromechanical sounds are heard off-stage. They could be related to Rachel's obsessive activity.  She pauses and then hits a button hard - the sound of rain  begins nearby. A LONG BEAT and then a distant pinging sound off-stage.</p>
    <p class='action'>(Back in the SUNSET installation)The radio clicks on, &lt;&lt;music plays, selected by the sentiments supplied by the TOURISTS to the GUIDE&gt;&gt;. Sheena responds to the music.</p>

I dream of big sky and highways and family vacations. Dreams about old flames and new fire. I dream of Rottweilers in heat catching bicycles. I have dreams. Good and bad. I'm able to remember some. Others I can't forget. I guess everyone had dreams. Something to dream about.

I believe I fairy tales and  prince charming. Not like in a book maybe but i dreamed happy thoughts. I supposed it also rained once in a while. It's like a desert out there. When was the last time it rained? Do you remember? Rain and angels. I used to think I knew this city and had a place to call home. Now everything is one giant hot collage.... a mirage. No boundaries.

I haven't had anything green in years it seems like. Everything kinda withered or disappeared...like my life- but now? Now I want it. I feel my tongue get wet and start to shiver. It needs to taste something. Real food. Maybe an apple or a carrot or a.... (She tries to describe it.) ...A mango. Yeah. A fucking mango! I'll eat fruit and then get healthy enough to remember to forget and then I'll go back to my life. If I can remember where it is? I'M STARVING! I'm hungry. Hungry for the sensation in my throat when I speak certain words loud, the feeling of warmth I get when I read, the short lived bliss I'm in when I fuck and we fall asleep together- but with who?  I forget. I don't wanna remember anymore. I can sense it but I've forgotten what it tastes like. What's it like to be human?</p>

Later it will become clear to most that they are seeing imagery connected to someone there that night,. The audience, encouraged by the Travelers,  might also explore the Agora. THE IMAGES BEGIN TO MOVE ABOUT THE SPACE. The images they encounter seem to speed up and slow down according to the visitors proximity to the walls. The TRAVELERS move around the space, point to, comment on, engage the images, mixing with the TOURISTS and encouraging them to explore, speaking quietly and individually to them of smell, sound, taste, and touch - again, personalized by the performer.</p>

(ALL THESE FOODS SHOULD BE  PERSONAL AND IDIOSYNCRATIC? It should create and tell us who this person is)  I don't eat so much anymore but I eat when I dream. For days. Ice-cream, soda, broccoli- quesadillas- nachos, chicken mole  taco truck burritos.</p>
    <p class='action'>It's still perfect... in my dreams. The heat, the spice, the sticky, the sweet, the sharing of it. Being full. Whole.  I think that's why I'm hungry, why I need to eat.  I want to fill the emptiness.</p>
    <p class='action'>The other Travelers also speak to those tourist close to them, each speaks about and in the metaphore of the senses. These are all lyrical and mnemonic they are intimate momments shared but not too easily and not perhaps without cost.</p>

    <p class='dialogue travelers'>[Speaks of  sound, music, lyrics and languages in his dreams: "The first thing I remember hearing in my  mother singing in the kitchen and the  smell of frijoles. Music always seems to fill me joy memories. It's like the sound of water flowing, it gives life. The sounds of words matters to me etc"] 
First thing I remember is my momma singing in the kitchen and the smell of bacon. Saturday morning cartoons. Speed Racer and GI Joe followed by some Soul Train. Marvin Gaye baby. (He sings,) Music always seems to fill me with joyous memories. It's like the sound of water flowing it gives me life. Water balloon fights on the blacktop afterschool. Running after the ice cream man. Quenching our thirst at the water fountain cuz it belonged to us. The sound of water matters to me. Bigtime. I remember one day, my mom and I went down to the community pool over on Rosecrans. I asked my mom to look at me. "Look at me mom! Look at me! Look!" I bounced on the board and did a canonball. That thing was off the hook! Floating through the air and then...splash. Everything was in slow motion and distant, like an echoing field-(Eddie cups his ears)</p>

    <p class='dialogue travelers'>[Speaks of smells of the outdoors, of a room she remembers:  "I used to smoke but now the smell of it..esp. in my hair makes me want to- But ther are other smells, earlier smells No but me can smell them, like the memories of before my father died, before that... Picnics in Griffith Park, the smell of grass, a hotdog in the park - my father teaching me to swim,  smell of sunblock and the chorine at the Glassell Park public pool etc." ]
I used to smoke but now the smell of it makes me gag. That stuff just wouldn't come off my fingernails. I do other things now. I count the cracks on the sidewalk. I talk to myself. I wander the street and listen to Black Flag and drink six packs with hobos in Hollywood. But I don't smoke, like ever. I would die before having to smell that stuff on my fingernails again. God I hated that smell. It made me feel like a kid. Like when I used to eat crayons. I used to eat crayons. That's so fucking weird. I'm so fucking weird. This place is So. Fucking. Weird! My dad used to smoke, but he always smelled good. Like man. Like what a guy is supposed to smell like. Smoke and sweat. Like Kentucky Bourbon. Like...a ball park franks on the grill at Griffith Park. Vapor is stupid, but smoke, real smoke dissapears into thin air, but the smell always stains your clothes, and even water can't wash it off- (Sheena smells her shirt)</p>
    <p class='action'>They recognize some of the images, perhaps others are images uploaded by Tourists and Fans.</p>

    <p class='dialogue travelers'>[Speaks of reliving a day in his dreams, just by touch: "I touched her face in was warm, as we sat on Venice Beach, the sun making her squint, I brushed her hair and then saw I had left sandy fingerprints there. We walked to the pier in barefeet the sand hot and then cooler as neared the water etc."]
I touched her sun-kissed face and it was warm. It was a Sunday afternoon in Venice. We walked the canals and I held my skateboard. We were barefoot. The sand stuck to our bodies and slowly drifted off with every step. She didn't care that I was always angry at the world. She made me cool out and just relax and enjoy things without the guilt I was so accustomed to. We sat down and she got a splinter on her foot. Alluva sudden there was glass all around us. I tried to take the thing out of her foot but I needed a sharp object. I couldn't find one so I started asking for help. She started bleeding. I started becoming angry and then some guys showed up and took her away. She wanted to go. She was happy with them. My arm was broken and I couldn't carry her...so I walked back to the beach and threw my deck into the Pacific. The ocean swallowed it whole- the whole damn thing- (Felix cradles his arm)</p>

But we real poor now, you know? We real lost. Like looking out to the Pacific Ocean we real confused cuz the island of Catalina blocks out the rest of the world. Like before, I could walk out and hear Spanish all over the damn place you know? Man boy, we used to have picnics and barbecues over at El Dorado Park with all the Black and Pinoy and them big ass Samoan peoples and it was all real cool. You know? Real nice! Boy I used to cruise down 7th Street all the way down to Cal State just to stop by Fingerprints and buy some records. I used to play ball in Cambodia Town. I used to chow down with some tasty pho at Happy Bowl, and then hop on my Schwinn and go chill with the honeys at the Aquarium, but the best part, was when I smoked that sticky stuff over at the lifeguard tent at midnight. Yeah chula, you and me are gonna hit the Red Room Bar over on 4th Street, it's a place with all these punk rockers and they play soul music. And then we'll walk all crooked to the beach and cool out. We'll just sit there, all drunk and happy staring at the Queen Mary and the Pacific Ocean, and just talk and think about stuff. You know? We could do that. If you want-</p>

    <p class='action'>Criss-crossing the space are hundreds of strings with random objects hanging amongst them. From the ceiling hang small pictures twinkling metallic.

    <p class='action'>ANDI, a CITIZEN, sits staring up at the ceiling through a telescope that has a live camera inside (projected in the space and viewed by the WATCHERS).

Two rows of sleeping bags on the ground, about eight feet between the rows. From the sleeping bags come murmurred sounds of sleeping (perhaps the voices of the WATCHERS).</p>

    <p class='action'>One of the sleeping bags stirs. Lucy hums a lullaby to comfort them, accompanied by the sound of traffic and the murmuring sleeping bag. She stops and looks at the TOURISTS.</p>

I never got a chance to show it to you, I was always too busy trying to make something happen. Getting my restaurant to take off.</p>

    </com-cue-publisher>    <p class='action'>A montage, a collage, an homage to  to the  culture of hard work and  comradeship in a  high level gradate school program. It starts again the sound of an airplance landing it, we hear the noise of the airplanes tires squeal upon landing. BACK IN THE USSR plays. Perhaps we  see TONY and TINA  kissing at LAX. YUKI walks by with a  LARGE backpack and a rolling carryon. She looks down at her phone confused- maybe she bumps into Matt.  A line of  people walking for the FYLAWAY back to Westwood. FELIX, YUKI, MATT and Daisy are in line, they do not know each other. Perhaps we see  Daisy and Felix sitting next to each other on the bus but facing away.</p>
    <p class='action'>Campus life, study groups. A football game YUKI looks on comfused. Video snippets of "MY WEEK AT GRAD SCHOOL" pop up at the same time on different screens. They talk about their journeys to LA. YUKI and MATT seem nervous DAISY is radiant The four are studying together only Felix has a beer in his hand. WE see and hear the four grad students all over Westwood and LA. Perhas we see FELIX's Asking "doesn't it EVER rain here?"</p>
    <p class='action'>Perhas we don't see any video of the students just their voices from the previous scene</p>
