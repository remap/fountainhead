    </com-olf>    <p class='action'>A young woman enters along with the  audience, the Tourists, she is carrying a large purse or backpack distractedly and using her  mobile device. She moves slowly thru the space  stopping  to  punch fiercely at her device and whisper to herself. She seems to be expecting someone, ("Where are you, it's gonna start. You're gonna be late") It begins subtlely and grows in  intensity as the time to enter grows close, at first she  should appear to just be part of the audience. Eventually she stops in the center of the space and drops her bag. A light slowly comes up on this  woman. She is RACHEL a TRAVELER, in the Lobby with the TOURISTS. She appears to be texting or playing or on her mobile device obsessively. The WATCHERS are...watching.</p>
    <p class='action'>Electromechanical sounds are heard off-stage. They could be related to Rachel's obsessive activity.  She pauses and then hits a button hard - the sound of rain  begins nearby. A LONG BEAT and then a distant pinging sound off-stage.</p>

Why am I here- where are you!
I have dreams. Strange dreams. I have so many things I don't want to think about that my mind wanders when I shut my eyelids. I dream of colors and animals and newborn babies crawling. I dream of big sky and highways and family vacations. Dreams about old flames and new fire. I dream of Rottweilers in heat catching bicycles. I have dreams. Good and bad. I'm able to remember some. Others I can't forget. I guess everyone had dreams. Something to dream about. 
Someone
But then you wake up
To events .
Where are you damn it?

I believe I fairy tales and  prince charming. Not like in a book maybe but i dreamed happy thoughts. I supposed it also rained once in a while. It's like a desert out there. When was the last time it rained? Do you remember? Rain and angels. I used to think I knew this city and had a place to call home. Now everything is one giant hot collage.... a mirage. No boundaries.

I haven't had anything green in years it seems like. Everything kinda withered or disappeared...like my life- but now? Now I want it. I feel my tongue get wet and start to shiver. It needs to taste something. Real food. Maybe an apple or a carrot or a.... (She tries to describe it.) ...A mango. Yeah. A fucking mango! I'll eat fruit and then get healthy enough to remember to forget and then I'll go back to my life. If I can remember where it is? I'M STARVING! I'm hungry. Hungry for the sensation in my throat when I speak certain words loud, the feeling of warmth I get when I read, the short lived bliss I'm in when I fuck and we fall asleep together- but with who?  I forget. I don't wanna remember anymore. I can sense it but I've forgotten what it tastes like. What's it like to be human?</p>

Running after the ice cream man. Quenching our thirst at the water fountain cuz it belonged to us. The sound of water matters to me. Big time. I remember one day, my mom and I went down to the community pool over on Rosecrans.</p>

I couldn't find one so I started asking for help. She started bleeding.</p>

Gang riffs, g-funk, crime rates, police chases. Nah fuck that. There's always been more to this place than just violence and food stamps, government cheese and milk from the WIC. That's not what defines this place . It's the people, it's their work, their music and language. The *food*, the *flavor,</em> and the sensation it leaves on your tongue. I always thought this was the best place any kid could run around in. Every block had a different beat, rhythm, and stench of faraway places. Every street had its own flash of graffitti, it's own style and codes of conduct. I didn't think of any of the bad stuff, just the good stuff, and there is a TON of good stuff here chula. Back in the day, I was in tune with all the good things-</p>

    <p class='action'>Like before, I could walk out and hear Spanish all over the damn place you know? My family used to have picnics and barbecues over at El Dorado Park with all the Black guys and Filipino homeboys and them big ass Samoan dudes and it was real cool. You know? <em>Real nice</em>. I wanna show you that part of Long Beach. The old part that sticks inside me forever.</p>
    <p class='action'>Look guapa, you an me are gonna cruise down 7th Street all the way down to Cal State and then chow down with some tasty pho at Happy Bowl. AND I don't care that I don't gotta car, you can hop on the handle bars of my banging Bianchi, or we can buy a buss pass with LB Transit, but after we eat we can head over to the Aquarium and stare at the jellyfish-</p>
    <p class='action'>AND THEN! After that we'll buy a bottle of Rosé and hit up the Sunken City in San Pedro cuz...I don't really dig Rosé but you do and...I like San Pedro.  
Then we'll just sit there, all drunk and happy staring at the Pacific Ocean with the Sun rising up and seagulls passing by...You know? We could do that. If you want-</p>

Lost they encourage the TOURISTS to join them in the  search. Perhaps it become a game, a sort of scavenger hunt. They are somehow  rewarded when they find  certain images. Maybe its a giant CONCENTRATION game? Some  images may have been uploaded by the WATCHERS.</p>

In high school I was a math nerd with a skate board. Then I met Daisy. She made me chill out and just relax and enjoy things. We would walk to the pier in our bare feet, the sand hot and then cooler as  we neared the water. Daisy always said that salt water was cleansing. Like tears, like the ocean- tears can just swallow us whole- all our memories and it cleanses us.</p>
    <p class='action'>One Sunday afternoon in Venice Beach, we walked the canals and I held her hand... with my skateboard in the other. We were barefoot.
