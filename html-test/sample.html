    <p class='action'>THE ARCHIVE contains real and fictional memories of <<Los Angeles>> - images, audio, video, text, and other media gathered by the company and supplemented by the WATCHERS.</p>
    <p class='action center'><strong>Code</strong></p>
    <p class='action'>LOS ATLANTIS incorporates software code that dynamically updates the script based on the context of the performance: where it is performed, what media is in THE ARCHIVE, who is attending, etc.</p>
    <p class='action'>Double angle brackets, <<>> are used to indicate sections in the script that are to be replaced programmatically by code.</p>
    <p class='action'>In this version of the script, the rules by which the replacement occurs is suggested by the example text inside the brackets but not explicitly described.</p>
    <p class='action center'><strong>Technical Elements</strong></p>
    <p class='action'>This script is typically accompanied by, but does not require, a diagram showing the relative location of major technical elements (archive projection, access control kiosks, signs, etc.)  These are denoted throughout as follows:</p>
    <p class='action'>AC-xyz		Access control element.</p>
    <p class='action'>CAM-xyz	Live camera.</p>
    <p class='action'>PRJ-xyz	Projection of Archive: video and sound.</p>
    <p class='action'>SND-xyz	Sound source for FX only.</p>
    <p class='action'>SGN-xyz	Digital sign (projected or otherwise)</p>

But it's not impossible to imagine losing my appetite for those things; they aren't always easy, and they take so much time. In twenty years I'd be interviewing air and water and heat just to remember they mattered."</p>

    <p class='action'>A pin lite comes up on two backpacks. Perhaps one is labeled "OPEN ME", the other says" GUESS WHAT'S INSIDE?". Inside is a map of a particular <<Los Angeles>> park, a radio, and other items needed for a hike. Perhaps other blankets are scattered and spread out</p>

Each Transfer takes advantage of crowdsourcing, so thank you for being willing to participate.  It is through the wisdom of the Village that we gain insight into individuals.

    <p class='action'>The follow happens during this sunset installation.    <span class='olf'>Medium shot of RACHEL amidst the other TRAVELERS and TOURISTS, possibly intercut with CU of their reactions. </span></p>
    <p class='action'>A young woman enters along with the  audience, the Tourists, she is carrying a large purse or backpack distractedly and using her  mobile device. She moves slowly thru the space  stopping  to  punch fiercely at her device and whisper to herself. She seems to be expecting someone, (<em>"Where are you, it's gonna start. You're gonna be late")</em> It begins subtlely and grows in  intensity as the time to enter grows close, at first she  should appear to just be part of the audience. Eventually she stops in the center of the space and drops her bag. A light slowly comes up on this  woman. She is RACHEL a TRAVELER, in the Lobby with the TOURISTS. She appears to be texting or playing or on her mobile device obsessively. The WATCHERS are...watching.</p>
    <p class='action'>Electromechanical sounds are heard off-stage. They could be related to Rachel's obsessive activity.  She pauses and then hits a button hard - the sound of rain  begins nearby. A LONG BEAT and then a distant pinging sound off-stage.</p>
    <p class='action'>(Back in the SUNSET installation)The radio clicks on, <<music plays, selected by the sentiments supplied by the TOURISTS to the GUIDE>>. Sheena responds to the music.</p>

    <p class='action'>Music continues, then fades replace by pinging as the lights rise  on RACHEL.</p>
    <p class='scene-heading'>SHE SPEAKS : FIRST INTRODUCTION</p>
    <p class='action'>Rachel looks up seemingly in a daze. She speaks slowly at first as if trying to remember something. Perhaps there are  projections/images that elicit her  speaking  but these  should be faded, blurry, hard to see.</p>
    <p class='character rachel onliners'>RACHEL</p>

I dream of big sky and highways and family vacations. Dreams about old flames and new fire. I dream of Rottweilers in heat catching bicycles. I have dreams. Good and bad. I'm able to remember some. Others I can't forget. I guess everyone had dreams. <em>Something to dream about</em>.

    <p class='dialogue onliners'>Once upon a time. (she laughs softly)
I believe I fairy tales and  prince charming. Not like in a book maybe but i dreamed happy thoughts. I supposed it also rained once in a while. It's like a desert out there. When was the last time it rained? Do you remember? Rain and angels. I used to think I knew this city and had a place to call home. Now everything is one giant hot collage.... a mirage. No boundaries. No neighborhoods. I float. I'm drifting in a sea of regret. No good memories left and no damn connection.</p>

Pizza. Pasta. Salad with bread. Tortillas. Mole. Arroz con Leche. Cookies. Candy. Lots of candy. Cereal and Cranberry Juice. Pan Dulce. I'm hungry. I'm so hungry I could eat a Horse or a goat...yeah  cabrito! I feel like a dead dog without meat on its bones. I'm hungry  but I don't eat  much anymore.I haven't had meat in ages... It's disgusting. I haven't had anything green in years it seems like. Everything kinda withered or disappeared...like my life- but now? Now I <em>want* it. I feel my tongue get wet and start to shiver. It needs to taste something. Real food. Maybe an apple or a carrot or a.... (*She tries to describe it.)* ...A *mango</em>. Yeah. A fucking mango! I'll eat fruit and then get healthy enough to remember to forget and then I'll go back to my life. If I can remember where it is? I'M STARVING! I'm hungry. Hungry for the sensation in my throat when I speak certain words loud, the feeling of warmth I get when I read, the short lived bliss I'm in when I fuck and we fall asleep together- but with who?  I forget. I don't wanna remember anymore. I can sense it but I've forgotten what it tastes like. What's it like to be human?</p>

    <p class='dialogue onliners'>Do you know? Can you remember?

    <p class='action'>The travelers begin to spread out and explore the images throughout the space. These are NOT random images... Altho' they might seem to be at this point. Later it will become clear to most that they are seeing imagery connected to someone there that night,. The audience, encouraged by the Travelers,  might also explore the Agora. THE IMAGES BEGIN TO MOVE ABOUT THE SPACE. The images they encounter seem to speed up and slow down according to the visitors proximity to the walls. The TRAVELERS move around the space, point to, comment on, engage the images, mixing with the TOURISTS and encouraging them to explore, speaking quietly and individually to them of smell, sound, taste, and touch - again, personalized by the performer.</p>

When I was a little I could EAT. I ate for days. Ice-cream, soda, broccoli, caulifower, he was so surprised I LOVED CAULIFLOWER and toast. Eggs, bacon, oatmeal, cereal and soup- tomato soup... from a CAN!
(ALL THESE FOODS SHOULD BE  PERSONAL AND IDIOSYNCRATIC? It should create and tell us who this person is)  I don't eat so much anymore but I eat when I dream. For days. Ice-cream, soda, broccoli- quesadillas- nachos, chicken mole  taco truck burritos.</p>
    <p class='action'>It's still perfect... in my dreams. The heat, the spice, the the sticky, the sweet, the sharing of it. Being full. Whole.  I think that's why I'm hungry, why I need to eat.  I want to fill the emptiness.</p>
    <p class='action'>The other Travelers also speak to those tourist close to them, each speaks about and in the metaphore of the senses. These are all lyrical and mnemonic they are intimate momments shared but not too easily and not perhaps without cost.</p>

    <p class='dialogue online-audience'>[Speaks of  sound, music, lyrics and languages in his dreams: "<em>The first thing I remember hearing in my  mother singing in the kitchen and the  smell of frijoles. Music always seems to fill me joy memories. It's like the sound of water flowing, it gives life. The sounds of words matters to me etc"*] 
First thing I remember is my momma singing in the kitchen and the smell of bacon. Saturday morning cartoons. Speed Racer and GI Joe followed by some Soul Train. Marvin Gaye baby. (He sings,) Music always seems to fill me with joyous memories. It's like the sound of water flowing it gives me life. Water balloon fights on the blacktop afterschool. Running after the ice cream man. Quenching our thirst at the water fountain cuz it belonged to us. The sound of water matters to me. Bigtime. I remember one day, my mom and I went down to the community pool over on Rosecrans. I asked my mom to look at me. "Look at me mom! Look at me! Look!" I bounced on the board and did a canonball. That thing was off the hook! Floating through the air and then...*splash</em>. Everything was in slow motion and distant, like an echoing field-(Eddie cups his ears)</p>

Picnics in Griffith Park, the smell of grass, a hotdog in the park - my father teaching me to swim,  smell of sunblock and the chorine at the Glassell Park public pool* etc." ]
I used to smoke but now the smell of it makes me gag. That stuff just wouldn't come off my fingernails. I do other things now. I count the cracks on the sidewalk. I talk to myself. I wander the street and listen to Black Flag and drink six packs with hobos in Hollywood. But I don't smoke, like ever. I would die before having to smell that stuff on my fingernails again. God I hated that smell. It made me feel like a kid. Like when I used to eat crayons. I used to eat crayons. That's so fucking weird. I'm so fucking weird. This place is So. Fucking. Weird! My dad used to smoke, but he always smelled good. Like man. Like what a guy is supposed to smell like. Smoke and sweat. Like Kentucky Bourbon. Like...a ball park franks on the grill at Griffith Park. Vapor is stupid, but smoke, *real</em> smoke dissapears into thin air, but the smell always stains your clothes, and even water can't wash it off- (Sheena smells her shirt)</p>

I touched her sun-kissed face and it was warm. It was a Sunday afternoon in Venice. We walked the canals and I held my skateboard. We were barefoot. The sand stuck to our bodies and slowly drifted off with every step. She didn't care that I was always angry at the world. She made me cool out and just relax and enjoy things without the guilt I was so accustomed to. We sat down and she got a splinter on her foot. Alluva sudden there was glass all around us. I tried to take the thing out of her foot but I needed a sharp object. I couldn't find one so I started asking for help. She started bleeding. I started becoming angry and then some guys showed up and took her away. She wanted to go. She was happy with them. My arm was broken and I couldn't carry her...so I walked back to the beach and threw my deck into the Pacific. The ocean swallowed it whole- the whole damn thing- (Felix cradles his arm)</p>

My window faces north, at the end of a row of small houses, inside a cul de sac, at the edge of a dusty neighborhood overlooking a cemented river in Chavez Ravine. The telephone wires hang low. Like Electricity about to touch the Earth. Sparks sometimes fly. Sometimes I make sound. So close and yet so far. I've written stories about this place. I dream of being an astronaut. Like Ellen Ochoa. You have to be good at math, but I'm pretty terrible at it. You have to be physically fit, but I can't run very fast. I can't speak, but I make up stories.

    <p class='action'>And Lucy joins in encouraging the TOURISTS to hum or sing along as well.</p>
    <p class='action'>She continues until someone sings. The sound of a bicycle begins. One of THE ARCHIVE's videos of <<@a person on a bicycle>> plays.</p>

    <p class='action'>The bicyclist rides along the ceiling getting smaller. She rides down the wall and approaches the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
    <p class='action'>At an appointed time (no matter where the scene is) a cue (via PRJ-RC*) signals that Ritual 1 is over. The Transfer fades and the TOURISTS exit back to the Agora.</p>

    <p class='dialogue'>I have to go- and so do you.  Follow the music now... Keep playing Rachel. You got to keep playing.</p>
    <p class='action'>RACHEL gets up from the sleeping bag and goes to the small tunnel still playing. The TOURISTS follow. The bicyclist, now tiny, enters the tunnel and disappears into light</p>
    <p class='action'>The light fades. The traffic softens into the sound of waves.</p>
    <p class='scene-heading'>(IN THE OBSERVATORY)SCENE 3    <span class='olf'>The view of all WATCHERS returns to the cameras of the Agora as soon as the Ritual ends. </span></p>
    <p class='action'>The WATCHERS' view into the website has switched from four possible feeds to only the Agora (CAM-AG*), and the interface has changed, so that they feel that they are also in the Agora, through the OBSERVATORY.</p>

    <p class='action'>Here, the GUIDE is played by a live performer who chats with the WATCHERS or, if possible, a customized chatterbot. Either way, it possesses an attitude and intellect somewhere between ELIZA and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.</p>
    <p class='action'>Just as with the TOURISTS, it constantly makes odd, self-referential quotes about artifical intelligence.</p>
    <p class='action'>The scene plays out simultaneously with Scene 3B in the Agora, which is also visible to the WATCHERS.</p>
