<p class='offliners-def'>Offliners</p>
<p class='character-type-content-desc'>Humans who search for something that they can't remember or articulate. They seem to suffer some form of amnesia. Characterless, disheveled, weary, impulsive, lazy, shameless, reactive, irresponsible, empathic, thoughtless, selfish. By participating in the Rituals they are able to Upload parts of themselves into the Online City.</p>

<p class='online-audience-def'>Online Audience</p>
<p class='character-type-content-desc'>Live audience who physically attend the event. Tourists armed with cell phones and cameras.</p>

<p class='onliners-def'>Onliners</p>
<p class='character-type-content-desc'>Digitized entities living inside a cloud of mingled identity, information, and memory. Archetypes, spirits, demons, memes, brands - all the parts of us we have stored in representations. Intelligent, articulate, associative, poetic, seductive, insightful, parasitic, dangerous. When rituals are reenacted by visitors to the Archive the Onliners are able to briefly materialize in the Offline realm.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class='online-audience-def'>Online Audience</p>
<p class='character-type-content-desc'>Live audience who participate in the proceedings from their computers. They enter the Online Agora, where they can view the Archive's contents as well as upload their own images and memories.</p>

<p class='the-archive-def'>The archive</p>
<p class='setting-content-desc'>A technological temple, physical interface to the Online City and its people. A vast catalogue of signs, sights, sounds, creations, events, gestures, identities, memories, thoughts, and dreams. It also contains the Onliners, who exist in the timeless, dislocated realm within the Archive. They are like ghosts awakened and mobilized by the presence of Offline visitors. While the Onliners once considered the Cloud something like Heaven, they now realize they must be embodied through Rituals in order to survive. </p>
<p class='the-agora-def'>The agora</p>
<p class='setting-content-desc'>The first point of intersection between the Offline and Online worlds. For a person to transcend their physical body, to Upload, they must progress from the Offline Agora to the Ritual Chamber to the Online Agora. The Agora thus has a offline version (in the live playing space) and an online version (accessible by the Online Audience). </p>
<p class='the-ritual-chambers-def'>The ritual Chambers</p>
<p class='setting-content-desc'>Rooms that contain visceral Simulations (audio, video, and immersive/interactive) of specific Places in the City wherein the Offline interface with the Online through various Rituals. When Offline visitors enter a chamber the Online awaken. As the Offline interact with the Simulations the Online become more material, active, and engaged.</p>
<p class='setting-content-desc'>The Ritual actions must be independent of the content of the Archive but must by Code define the use of this content (as content will change when the Archive appears in different Cities).</p>
<p class='setting-content-desc'>The use of media in the Ritual Chambers must be dynamically linked to the actions of the characters and the audience, and should incorporate echoes of the real-world lives of the audience, responsiveness to their actions as characters within the piece, and possibly further agency as contributors.</p>
