    </com-chat-control-muc>    <p class='action'>A group of TOURISTS follow Felix. They hear sounds coming from behind a dark curtain. FELIX approaches slowly and opens the curtain, he enters with TOURISTS trailing in behind him.</p>
    <p class='action'>From the ceiling hang small pictures twinkling metallic and other random objects. There is a box with little silver telescopes. A circular diagram is illuminated on the floor in front of them. In the corner, a printer periodically outputs new stills from THE ARCHIVE that have been selected by the WATCHERS.</p>
    <p class='action'>ANDI, a CITIZEN, is rearranging things along the perimeter of the diagram. Like the other CITIZENS, her clothing looks out of place.

    <p class='dialogue'>You have to be good at math, but I'm pretty terrible at it. You have to physically fit, but I can't run very fast. We make up stories about all kinds of things. Like these things! <strong><em>Look! Read! Share!</strong></em></p>

    <p class='dialogue '>&lt;&lt;We used to take the I-5 down to Disneyland every year.&gt;&gt;</p>
    <p class='action'>ANDI V.O.
Mom was obsessed with the happiest place on earth. That was the only time of year we could eat anything, anything we wanted. Funnel cakes. Ice cream. Churros. But we weren't allowed to talk during the fireworks. Mom looked at them as if they were made of magic. My favorite spot was Tomorrowland because that's where I decided I wanted to be an astronaut. This was just before Cassie was born. She was so little. So, so little. Cassiopeia 6lbs 3 oz. She had a birthmark the shape of a W on her shoulder. Born off the 10 freeway at Kaiser Permanente in 1983.  </p>
    <p class='action'>FELIX picks up a little silver telescope from the box. He looks through it and shows the TOURISTS.</p>

    <p class='dialogue '>&lt;&lt;August 1976: Skateboarders in Venice beach.&gt;&gt;</p>
    <p class='action'>ANDI V.O.
Venice is a residential, commercial, and recreational beachfront neighborhood founded in 1905 as a seaside resort town. It was an independent city until 1926, when it merged with Los Angeles. The 2000 U.S. census counted 37,705 residents in the 3.17-square-mile Venice neighborhood--an average of 11,891 people per square mile, about the norm for Los Angeles; in 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 40,885.</p>

    <p class='dialogue '>&lt;&lt;May 2010: a quinceañera of a girl from Sinaloa.&gt;&gt;</p>
    <p class='action'>ANDI V.O.
I always wanted to have a quinceanera. All the girls at school got to where to those awesome fluffy dresses. They were pinks and turquoise and orange and blue. They got SO many presents. Best of all they got to wear a tiara. Like a princess. This was their rite of passage.</p>

    <p class='dialogue '>&lt;&lt;January 2012: an Ethiopian baptism in Dodger Stadium.&gt;&gt;</p>
    <p class='action'>ANDI V.O.
Baptism comes from the greek word Baptisma. Váptisma. Derived from the noun Baptizo which means "I wash." We were driving around Echo park when we saw the commotion. It wasn't a Dodger game. Everyone was wearing white. There were pools of water everywhere. Tears. Dancing. Chorós. Celebration. Eortasmós. It was a baptism!</p>
    <p class='character tourist-3'>TOURIST 3</p>
    <p class='dialogue '>&lt;&lt;July 2014: a magical Peruvian dance.&gt;&gt;</p>
    <p class='action'>ANDI V.O.
The oldest proof of existence of dancing comes from the 9000 year old cave paintings that were found in India. In most ancient civilizations, dancing before the god is an important element in temple ritual. Danza Pukklay is a dance to celebrate play. The stomping represents the formations of clouds in that year's harvest.</p>

    <p class='action'>ANDI V.O.
2002. Belmont High School Graduation. There were six-hundred and sixty-seven people graduating that year. Cassie should have been one of them.  They read her name anyway. A special posthumous degree. 336 girls. 331 boys. 67.9% of high school students in Los Angeles graduate. Doctors. Writers. Actors. Musicians. Scientists. Firefighters. Cassie wanted to be a teacher. She was on UA flight 175. 1+7+5. 13. I remember when we were 13</p>
