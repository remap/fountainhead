# Characters

> _CHARACTERS_ <

OFFLINERS         	Humans who search for something that they can't remember or articulate. They seem to suffer some form of amnesia. Characterless, disheveled, weary, impulsive, lazy, shameless, reactive, irresponsible, empathic, thoughtless, selfish. By participating in the Rituals they are able to Upload parts of themselves into the Online City.  

OFFLINE AUDIENCE	Live audience who physically attend the event. Tourists armed with cell phones and cameras.

ONLINERS         	Digitized entities living inside a cloud of mingled identity, information, and memory. Archetypes, spirits, demons, memes, brands – all the parts of us we have stored in representations. Intelligent, articulate, associative, poetic, seductive, insightful, parasitic, dangerous. When rituals are reenacted by visitors to the Archive the Onliners are able to briefly materialize in the Offline realm.

ONLINE AUDIENCE	Live audience who participate in the proceedings from their computers. They enter the Online Agora, where they can view the Archive's contents as well as upload their own images and memories.

# Setting

> SETTING <



**The Archive**: A technological temple, physical interface to the Online City and its people. A vast catalogue of signs, sights, sounds, creations, events, gestures, identities, memories, thoughts, and dreams. It also contains the Onliners, who exist in the timeless, dislocated realm within the Archive. They are like ghosts awakened and mobilized by the presence of Offline visitors. While the Onliners once considered the Cloud something like Heaven, they now realize they must be embodied through Rituals in order to survive. 



**The Agora**: The first point of intersection between the Offline and Online worlds. For a person to transcend their physical body, to Upload, they must progress from the Offline Agora to the Ritual Chamber to the Online Agora. The Agora thus has a offline version (in the live playing space) and an online version (accessible by the Online Audience). 

**The Ritual Chambers**: Rooms that contain visceral Simulations (audio, video, and immersive/interactive) of specific Places in the City wherein the Offline interface with the Online through various Rituals. When Offline visitors enter a chamber the Online awaken. As the Offline interact with the Simulations the Online become more material, active, and engaged.

The Ritual actions must be independent of the content of the Archive but must by Code define the use of this content (as content will change when the Archive appears in different Cities).

The use of media in the Ritual Chambers must be dynamically linked to the actions of the characters and the audience, and should incorporate echoes of the real-world lives of the audience, responsiveness to their actions as characters within the piece, and possibly further agency as contributors.

ADMISSION



Call to Adventure:

(The Public is notified that the problems of Time and Space have been solved. They are invited to marvel at and participate in an awe-inspiring new Archive of their City.)

Entrance: Admittance

(To be able to enter the Archive all Offline Audience must have an E ticket, which they have received a week to one day in advance. This is an electronic pass via a mobile device that must be activated to gain entrance. The Online Audience also must have a password in order to access the online Agora.)

(To activate their Epass the Audience must agree to input written memories and images of their lives, routines, rituals, and of places in their City. These memories and images will be stored in the Archive, for use at the end of the show.)

(Once their Epass is activated the Offline are given instructions on where to upload images and video taken with their phones during the course of the performance. The Online receive an address for the online Agora, instructions on how to use its interface, and suggestions on how to interact with the Offline.)

Acceptance:

(The entrance to the Archive.)

(Once the Offline have signified acceptance of the rules of engagement by beginning their initial upload their Epass is activated and they are able to be admitted, as their personal device is linked to the archive.)

(Once the Online signify acceptance they log on and begin to view what is occurring.)

# ACT [I] SCENE 1

.ACT I

.SCENE I

(A dimly lit antechamber with seating and a locked door.)

(The Offline Audience enters, among them is at least one Offliner. The Offliner is disheveled and disoriented but does not call attention to herself. Occasional electronic sounds are heard off-stage. The Offliner tries the door but finds it locked. She sits.)

(The Offline Audience discuss amongst themselves the strangeness of being invited to the end of Time and Space. Or else they are silent. Either way, the blandness of the antechamber must be disappointing. Meanwhile the Offliner frets and asks the others if they remember her, if they know the time, if they know the way in, etc. They may respond or ignore her. She does seem to be suffering from amnesia as well as many other erratic psychosomatic disturbances.)

(After a period of time a chime rings. Text appears above the door: “UPLOAD A PICTURE FOR IDENTIFICATION”. The Offliner tries the locked door again. Still locked. She asks anyone if they have a phone.)

(She begs the audience to take her picture. When someone does, and uploads it, the door will open. Everyone must also have their picture taken in order to enter. All comply and enter.)



===

# ACT [I] SCENE 2

.ACT [I]

.SCENE [2]

(A long, narrow, dimly lit and winding tunnel.)

(The Offline Audience follow the Offliner who wanders, now curious, now excited, now listless, now excited again. She stops suddenly and points. Someone finds a small flashlight and gives it to her. She continues down the hallway. The walls flicker and seem to quiver. In the distance is a faint buzzing sound; as they get closer it seems to be thousands of recorded phone calls. The Offliner talks about her hunger for something- she doesn't know what, she can't remember it's name.)

(A stroke of lightning. The voices change in quality. Wind shakes the walls of the tunnel. Dim lights flicker through the fog. As they walk by these lights they become photos, video, brief archival events, everyday events that slowly begin to be interwoven with scenes of sterile and decaying views of an emptying and desolate City. The Offline travel through the darkness until-)

(PING! A welcoming sound. A new light glimmers in the distance, warm and friendly. The Offliner turns towards it.)

(The growing murmur is now more distinct. The voices of the Onliners can barely be made out, calling the Offline into the Archive.)

(The Offline follow the light to the entrance to the Agora. All enter.)

===

# ACT [I] SCENE 3

.ACT [I]

.SCENE [3]

(The Agora. An open space with multiple entrances. A small island surrounded by soft clouds drifting through shafts of light. Faint flickering images from the Archive spin around the space.)

(One at time four other groups enter, each with at least one Offliner. As each group enters the Agora awakens; <the images grow brighter and more distinct.>)

(As the Offline explore the Agora <the images speed up and slow down according to the visitors proximity to the walls.> The Offliners, transfixed, run about the room trying to follow the images. They feel fear, amazement, joy, and deja vu.)

(Shadows fly across the walls. The Onliners can finally be heard distinctly in the space. They welcome the Offline to the Archive. The Offliners ask them who they are. The Onliners explain something like - "we are the Online. We are your memories, your dreams, your creations, your true selves. We are your City." The Onliners invite the Offline to play games with them. The Offliners, excited, agree.)

(The Onliners spin around the space. The Offliners try to follow the shadows of the Online, forcing the whole audience to move through and into each other.)

(When the Offline moves towards the images, the images slow down to a stop. The Offliners each stop in front of a different still image. The shadows of the Onliners disappear. Their voices remain. They invite the Offliners to step into the images. The Offline discover slits in the walls of the Agora and step into the Ritual Chambers.)

# ACT [II] SCENE 1

.ACT [II]

.SCENE [1]

.RITUAL 1 (OF 5) EPISODE 1 (OF 3): FOREPLAY

(Ritual Chamber - *Episode Authors insert Simulations of places in the City here*)

(The first Ritual Cycle is an interactive presentation of the kind of material the Archive holds. The Online give the Offline a taste of their world through a gently interactive but engaging and exciting reenactment of something pulled from the Archive of the City. These are the "surface" memories, mostly pleasurable.)

(The Online help, teach, or coax the Offline into taking a role in this reenactment. The more the Offline participate, the more the Online become present in the space. This is a pleasurable experience, esp. for the Online who are now ALIVE in the memory. NOTE: Any “meaning” imparted in the course of the ritual should come implicitly from its context within the overall piece. The simulated location should be purposely disconnected from the ritual actions.)

(During the Ritual, the Offline Audience are encouraged to participate in any way possible, but at the least to take photos or video of the events, which are uploaded and incorporated into the Ritual and the Archive.)

*(Insert Rituals (1-5) HERE)*

(At an appointed time (no matter what is happening) a CUE signals that Episode One is over. The Simulation fades and the Offline exit back to the AGORA.)



===

# ACT [II] SCENE 2

.ACT [II]

.SCENE [2]

(The Agora)

(Everyone returns to the Agora. The Offliners (and hopefully the Offline Audience) discuss how wonderful and intriguing their experience was. As they discuss, images uploaded by the Offline Audience in Episode 1 appear on the walls of the Agora. Delighted, the Offliners want more. They tell the Onliners how lucky they are to live in this marvelous place without space or time. The Onliners ask if the Offline would really like to live there. The Offliners say of course. The Onliners tell them there is a way, and they can help them.)

(The Onliners explain that the Offline have already begun to Upload. In fact many of the images of the City in the Archive were once theirs, but apparently the Offline have forgotten them. All the things they have been missing are here in the Archive. The next step in human evolution is to Upload themselves. The Offliners desperately want it.)

(The Offline are presented with a new stream of images. The Onliners encourage them to choose images they feel a deep connection to. The Offline choose Chambers.)

===

# ACT [II] SCENE 3

.ACT [II]

.SCENE [3]

.RITUAL 1 (OF 5) EPISODE 2 (OF 3): PRIMAL UPLOAD

(Ritual Chamber - *Episode Authors insert Simulations here*)

(Second Ritual Cycle. The Online have chosen primal rituals by which the Offliners must reenact deep, dark memories. This episode is more specific, elaborate and interactive than the first. The Offliners are driven by their desire to enter the Online realm, but the Primal Ritual is very physically and emotionally demanding. As they endure this trial the Onliners also demand more help from the Offline Audienceto encourage the Offliners and to upload many photos and video of them.)

(The Online can tell that the Offliners are floundering under the stress, but they push even harder, becoming visually manifest in the space. The Offliners break down in the midst of the ritual, emotionally and physically injuring themselves. The Upload has failed.)

*(Insert Rituals 1-5, Episode 2 here.)*

(A CUE signals that the Ritual is over. In pain and frustration the Online and Offline rush back to the Agora.)

===

# ACT [II] SCENE 4

.ACT [II]

.SCENE [4]

(The Offline and Online return to the Agora. The Offliners are in terrible shape, psychologically and physically a mess. The Onliners frantically try to sort out what went wrong. They thought by getting the Offliners to Upload and leave their bodies then they, the Onliners, could enter those bodies to once again exist in physical space and time. Why would they want to leave the Archive? Because, the Onliners admit, they need some form of embodiment, which occurs during the rituals, in order to exist.)

(The Offline Audience may now distrust the Onliners, but they must collaborate in order to save the dying Offliners. The Onliners convince the Offline Audience that there must be a way to use the content in the Archive to revive the Offliners, as it was all extracted from them and their City. They invite everyone once more into the Ritual Chambers.)

===

# ACT [III] SCENE 1

.ACT [III]

.SCENE [1]

.RITUAL 1 (OF 5) EPISODE 3 (OF 3): MASHUP

(The Ritual Chamber - *Authors insert New Simulations here*)

(This must be the most elaborate and interactive Episode. It must contain space and potential for many rituals and multiple activities as the Offline Audience, Onliners, and Online Audience try everything to revive the dying.)

(The Offliners beg for obscure and contradictory things, absurdities, and the Online and Offline pillage the Archive of the City trying to satisfy them.)

(The Archive's content becomes chaotic as the Online frenetically try to save the Offliners. Everyone Online and Offline can assist and perhaps be seen assisting. But everything they do only seems to make the Offliners worse! Parts of the Offliners float screaming in the Archive. Nothing is working, and time is precious...)

(In their efforts the Onliners become more physically present in the space, getting closer and closer to the boundary between the worlds. In an act of desperation they finally burst through, entering the Offliners.)

> (*insert EPISODE THREE here*) <

(The walls of the chambers disintegrate.)

===

# ACT [III] SCENE 2

.ACT [III]

.SCENE [2]

(The Agora, expanded.)

(The machinery of the Archive whirs frenetically, the lights flickering on and off. The Online, now in the bodies of the Offliners, marvel at their new physicality. They reveal that these are very like bodies they themselves left when they Uploaded.)

(But then their attention is drawn to the Archive, which is in a terrible state. The impromptu Episode 3 scattered its contents. Images of the City and its people flash by on the walls in a glitching jumble. What is all this crap? All meaning has been lost.)

(The On/Offliners beg the Offline and Online Audience to help them make sense of the jumbled media. At this point the media the audience had been asked to input is drawn up and they must explain its importance. Together the Offline and Online Audience create new rituals, building new meaning from the specifics of time and space.)

(The On/Offliners become so enraptured by these new memories that they forget that these are just images. They follow the images out the doors the Archive, and walk as if in a dream towards the living City.)
