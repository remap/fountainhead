  // Matrix control publishing projector.#N NDN name
  // Speed, starttime, in the published content as well as url; optional field and omitting argument
  // 
  // Script in usable form: hiding, indexing (skip around scene); floating toolbar to control showing/hiding
  //   OLF first, probably need new Fountain+ for specific classes
  // Add web component class for all things generated by web component
  // PDF output
  //
  // Code and db review on Tuesday
  
  // TODO: This seems to only work in Chrome, verifying. There is a flag in Firefox that needs to be set to true
  // TODO: First click does not seem to work? Second and third works? Verifying
  
  // Note: referring to the ndnURLPublisherFactory would require this line to be executed after the script tags
