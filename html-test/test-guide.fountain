# Body

PROCESS FOR THE GUIDE

Zhehao will run pre-recorded and freetext guide chatter over the course show.  Zoe will supplement during the opening. 

Everyone can participate in chat in The Observatory, Zoe will also do freetext to the Observatory and take those cues.  

Zhehao will be THE GUIDE in The Observatory (so must be in character).

Zoe and others in the crew will be themselves as Citizens.  You can at any time in the Observatory, insert dialogue from the Citizens. 
Zoe will also have THE OBSERVATORY up. 

.Greeting

One/Two greeters at the table plus Zhehao

Greeters refer each person to Zhehao, who helps them login or if there is a problem, sends them to the default GUIDE page.

You’re not so normal yourself, dear.

I wish that I could be full screen, too.

Reiterate:: THE GUIDE reminds people “Choose who to follow” and opens the menu. 

.1C

THE GUIDE
I look out the window and see memories. 
Lots of memories.
I'm stargazer, looking into the lives of other celestial beings.
I hover above them and watch. {{ filter:c }}

THE GUIDE
Looks, read, share! {{ filter:c }}

THE GUIDE
Like it's talking! {{ filter:c }}

Read the pictures! Take a photo! Remember to say thank you! {{ filter:c }}

Listen to her. Imagine for her. Thank her. {{ filter:c }}

THE GUIDE
Listen to her. Imagine for her. Thank her. {{ filter:c }}

For example:  
1/A. “Bah. Fitness couples.” 
1/B. “Hungry. Again.”
1/C. “I… am… a staaaargazer”
	** DO TRANSLATION **
1/D. “...creepy”

TRANSITION BACK TO AGORA 1

Dialogue continues in the same vein, can potentially be the same for everyone for simplicity.

AGORA 2

Dialogue continues per the script and improv.

And then “DANCE PARTY” 

Continues in the same vein
Should probably avoid a comedic undercurrent during the last part of the scene when they freak out. Perhaps show some concern. 

Again, bring up who to follow at the end of the scene. 


RITUAL 2

Be pretty quiet in 2/A (Eddie and Rachel)

Can be funnier in 2/B (Felix and Sheena)


TRANSITION TO AGORA 3

Dialogue continues per the script. 

Guide could express some genuine concern. 

THE CITIZENS EMERGE / RITUAL 3

THE GUIDE talks about memories of (your) own, without ritual, and without explanation.
