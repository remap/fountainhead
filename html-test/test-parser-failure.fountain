.PARENTHETICAL TEST

<<@cue-publisher
  (t       = Lifetime realization,
   cid     = 141,
   desc    = Beach 1)>>

<<@cue-publisher
  (t       = ANDI: Look! Itâ€™s you at the Santa Monica Pier!,
   cid     = 141,
   desc    = Beach 1)>>

Felix walks over to the photo and looks at it (if he still has the telescope he points it at the picture.)

(lonely parenthetical)

THE GUIDE

.STOP IT TEST

RACHEL
(to <<RANDY>>, ignoring the mismatch)
It worked. Come with me. It's OK... I think. You were invited right?
One more line.
STOP IT
One more line.

.DUALDIALOGUE TEST

RACHEL
Where are you? You're late 
I don't wanna be here alone  
Where are you?
I don't wanna remember anymore
Why am I here- where are you!
I have dreams. Strange dreams. I have so many things I don't want to think about that my mind wanders when I shut my eyelids. I dream of colors and animals and newborn babies crawling. I dream of big sky and highways and family vacations. Dreams about old flames and new fire. I dream of Rottweilers in heat catching bicycles. I have dreams. Good and bad. I'm able to remember some. Others I can't forget. I guess everyone had dreams. Something to dream about. 
Someone
But then you wake up
To events .
Where are you damnit 
Why am I here in this-

A louder ping, closer. 

THE GUIDE
(to each TOURIST)
Time to your Transfer: << - 00 Days, 00 Hours, 00 Minutes>>. 

RACHEL
Did you hear that?

*olf: Title overlaid - Provide Identification Image*

A digital sign appears: "PROVIDE IDENTIFICATION IMAGE" 

THE GUIDE
(in a businesslike tone)
Image capture and authentication ready. 

THE OBSERVATORY ^
(in a status bar, regardless of what the WATCHERS are viewing)
Visitor arrival underway. [Link to view.] 

RACHEL tries to open the door. It's locked.

THE GUIDE
Please use your guide.

RACHEL ^
Damnit  I know he's in there. I got in yesterday!

Her phone is also dead. 

THE GUIDE
Alright, now it's time, <<Yuki Izumihara>>. Take your picture to authorize entry.

RACHEL ^
(seeing what the TOURISTS' GUIDES say)
Shit it's dead. Everything is  dead  or dying. I need.... I need your help... Please take my picture yeah? Someone- anyone? 

RACHEL takes a photo of herself using a TOURIST'S phone.

THE GUIDE
Confirmed, <<Randy Illum>>.  (Photo of Rachel.) (Barcode.) 

RACHEL proceeds to show the barcode to the door's access control unit. 

THE ARCHIVE
(on projection by the door)
Confirmed, <<Randy Illum>>.  (Photo of Rachel.)

RACHEL
(to <<RANDY>>, ignoring the mismatch)
It worked. Come with me. It's OK... I think. You were invited right?

RACHEL gently grabs the hand of her new friend and enters.

The remaining TOURISTS take and upload a picture of themselves in order to enter, each showing the name+face+barcode combination on the GUIDE to the door access control unit (AC-A*).  

*olf: MCU of hands and phones doing the access scanning, cut with WS of other TOURISTS and TRAVELERS.* 

As the photos are scanned, THE OBSERVATORY is populated with the pictures of the TOURISTS (and the TRAVELERS) entering THE ARCHIVE. 

For each WATCHER, one TOURIST's photo is overlaid with the text "MEET". Clicking on it allows them to learn a bit about the TOURIST and "follow" them.

Like RACHEL, the other TRAVELERS borrow TOURISTS' phones and identities.  They do this throughout the performance, as needed.

# SCENE 4: DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE

= Rachel and her Tourists travel  down a dark passage way. They learn more about each other- so we need to try and add s some smple interaction. Some way to start to teach the aud. to interact and  participate.

.ACT 1

.SCENE 1: ADMISSION

*olf: Wide shot of the Lobby, occasionally zooming to medium shots of groups of TOURISTS and TRAVELERS.*

The TOURISTS filter into the Lobby of THE ARCHIVE. A sign reminds them to log in to the GUIDE on their mobile phones.

THE GUIDE
(to each TOURIST, after they log in on their phone, with a Clippy-like icon popping up)
Hello, {{ user_name }}!  Where do you want to go today? Just kidding... Welcome.  -Virgil. 

The TOURISTS browse their GUIDE. 

Gradually  the audience congregates  in the lobby. 

The WATCHERS logged into the OBSERVATORY are greeted. They can watch the live feed streaming to the OBSERVATORY. They can still browse THE ARCHIVE.
