This is a test, full of lies and fabrications, but truer for their inclusion.

====

**FADE IN:**

A TEST.

We're testing, watching a fat catfish swim along. <<@testComponent(arg1 = 'val1'  ,arg2 =val2,arg3="val3" , arg4=[infrastructure, array], arg5=(we, dont, support, nested, brackets)) my cool description>>. This seems very ambiguous.

This is The Test.

ZHEHAO (V.O.)
This seems to be a dialogue.

[[Three days without chocolate]]

[[Multi-line
   
Tests, even more days without chocolate]]

This seems to be an action. <<@testComponent(arg1 = ('val1'), arg2=cpp) this is re-occurrence of the same component>>

_This seems to be another action._

ZHEHAO (V.O.)(CONT'D)
**We actually have more than one dialogue.**

INT.  WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)

<<@testComponent2() this is another component with no arguments >>

Everything that looks like nothing seems to be action

<<@testComponent3(arg1 = 'this is a component, and it has no description') >>

<<@testComponent3(arg1 = 'this is a component, and it has no description')>>

> _**THE END**_ <
