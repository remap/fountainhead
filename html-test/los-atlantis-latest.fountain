# Environment

[showid] "chocolate_cookie_show"

[include] ndn.js
[prefix] new Name("/ndn/edu/ucla/remap/losatlantis")
[face] new Face({host: "localhost"})

# CharacterTypes

[Offliners] Humans who search for something that they can't remember or articulate. They seem to suffer some form of amnesia. Characterless, disheveled, weary, impulsive, lazy, shameless, reactive, irresponsible, empathic, thoughtless, selfish. By participating in the Rituals they are able to Upload parts of themselves into the Online City.

[Offline Audience] Live audience who physically attend the event. Tourists armed with cell phones and cameras.

[Onliners] Digitized entities living inside a cloud of mingled identity, information, and memory. Archetypes, spirits, demons, memes, brands - all the parts of us we have stored in representations. Intelligent, articulate, associative, poetic, seductive, insightful, parasitic, dangerous. When rituals are reenacted by visitors to the Archive the Onliners are able to briefly materialize in the Offline realm.

[Online Audience] Live audience who participate in the proceedings from their computers. They enter the Online Agora, where they can view the Archive's contents as well as upload their own images and memories.

# Characters

Sheena [Offliners] Sheena runs the parser

Rachel [Onliners] Rachel edits the CSS

Eddie [Online Audience] Eddie whines

Felix [Offline Audience] Felix makes chocolate

# Setting

[The archive] A technological temple, physical interface to the Online City and its people. A vast catalogue of signs, sights, sounds, creations, events, gestures, identities, memories, thoughts, and dreams. It also contains the Onliners, who exist in the timeless, dislocated realm within the Archive. They are like ghosts awakened and mobilized by the presence of Offline visitors. While the Onliners once considered the Cloud something like Heaven, they now realize they must be embodied through Rituals in order to survive. 

[The agora] The first point of intersection between the Offline and Online worlds. For a person to transcend their physical body, to Upload, they must progress from the Offline Agora to the Ritual Chamber to the Online Agora. The Agora thus has a offline version (in the live playing space) and an online version (accessible by the Online Audience). 

[The ritual Chambers] Rooms that contain visceral Simulations (audio, video, and immersive/interactive) of specific Places in the City wherein the Offline interface with the Online through various Rituals. When Offline visitors enter a chamber the Online awaken. As the Offline interact with the Simulations the Online become more material, active, and engaged.

The Ritual actions must be independent of the content of the Archive but must by Code define the use of this content (as content will change when the Archive appears in different Cities).

The use of media in the Ritual Chambers must be dynamically linked to the actions of the characters and the audience, and should incorporate echoes of the real-world lives of the audience, responsiveness to their actions as characters within the piece, and possibly further agency as contributors.

.PROLOGUE : ONLINE (INVITATION)

<<@1A/sunset(instance="1", description="iconic vistas of the sun setting over the city", style="color:#EEDDEE;text-decoration:underline;") Not as concise as it could be...I feel we need a design discussion.>>

In the weeks before the performance, potential audience members first encounter the Archive on the LOS ATLANTIS Website.

The “Guide” is a mobile website that the Candidates can access from their smartphone. (Audience members without smartphones will have to share someones)

In the days leading up to the event, its content is simply a countdown timer, identical to their view of Archive’s website. 

It may occasionally spout memes drawn from the Archive to pique the Interest of the Candidates.

.ADMISSION:  ENTRANCE- THE RULES

(At the time of the performance, the in-person audience enter the Lobby of the Archive which begins to interact with them. )

(Each “Guide” displays a barcode. )

(The sign further instructs them to scan at an unattended access control kiosk at the entrance to the Lobby (AC-L0). )

(Simultaneously, the Fans watch what unfolds via a live camera (CAM-L1) streaming to the website. )

THE ARCHIVE

THE ARCHIVE

(to each online Fan via their Fan Site ONLY)

Each Transfer Event crowdsources its curation and the shepherding of those being uploaded. Thank you for being willing to participate.  It is through the wisdom of the Village that we gain insight into individuals.  As the Transfer proceeds, you will watch the process live, and help curate their memories, and shepherd the uploaders through this challenging process to join you in the Archive.  Etc... 


(In the Lobby, the Guide timers reach -07 minutes. Five doors open. Over each door a digital sign (SGN-L*) flashes to life with the <<names of the Candidates who are to enter>>. )

(The website of the Fans is taken over by one of five live video feeds (CAM-A*), with the same names above it. )

.ACT I - SEPARATION - EACH GROUP MEETS ITS TRAVELER

(The audience (Candidates) enters the door corresponding to their name, thus splitting into small groups. )

(Each scene in this Act runs in parallel - one for each Traveler and group of about ten audience members. )

.SCENE 1 (@ RACHEL) - FLASHBACK

(A small antechamber with seating and a locked door. A small group of Candidates enter. )

(Each chamber is dimly lit by a  digital sign (SGN-A*) reading:  “Date of Transfer Event: <<Wednesday, June 1, 2026>>. Time: << + 00 Days, 08 Hours, 05 Minutes”>>.  )

(A Traveler, RACHEL, is in the room, texting or playing or on her mobile devise obsessively. Electromechanical sounds are heard off-stage, via SND-T*. They might seem to be related to Rachel’s obsessive activity.  She pauses and then hits a button hard- the sound of rain  begins nearby. A LONG BEAT and then a distant pinging sound off-stage.  The sign updates: “Date of Transfer Event: <<Thursday, June 1, 2026>>. Time: << + 00 Days, 00 Hours, 00 Minutes”>>.  )

(The Travelers in each room are heard only by their group of audience members. )

(RACHEL IS DISCOVERED. She looks up seemingly in a daze as if after a long night’s study cram. She addresses the Candidates.)

RACHEL
When I was a girl. I had dreams. Strange dreams. I had so many things to think about that my mind would always wander when I shut my eyelids. I dreamt with colors and animals and newborn babies crawling. I dreamt of big sky and highways and family vacations. Dreams about old flames and new fire. I dreamt of Rottweilers in heat. I had dreams. Good and bad. I was able to remember some well. Others not so much. Back then, everyone had dreams. *Everyone* had things going on. Happening. Events occurred. Now I can’t remember. Now we’re stuck here in this...this *wasteland*. 

(A louder ping, closer. )

RACHEL
Did you hear that?

(The sign (SGN-A*) starts blinking: “Date of Transfer Event: <<Thursday, June 1, 2026>>. Time: << + 00 Days, 00 Hours, 00 Minutes”>>.  )

(New text appears:“PROVIDE IDENTIFICATION IMAGE”)

(Rachel tries to open the door. It’s locked.)

RACHEL

(She has a phone but it’s dead she speaks to the audience)

Shit it’s dead. Everything is dying here. I need.... I need your help...Please take my picture yeah? Someone- anyone? 

(The Guides held by the Candidates switch into capture mode. )

THE ARCHIVE

(to each Candidate, on their Guide)

Ready for image capture, <<YUKI IZUMIHARA>>. 

(RACHEL takes a photo of herself using a Candidate’s Guide.)

THE ARCHIVE

(on the Guide used by Rachel)

Confirmed, <<RANDY ILLUM>>.  

(Photo of Rachel.) (Barcode.) 

(RACHEL proceeds to show the barcode to the door’s access control unit (AC-A*). )

THE ARCHIVE

(on a sign (SGN-A*) by the door)

Confirmed, <<RANDY ILLUM>>.  (Photo of Rachel.)

RACHEL

(ignoring the mismatch)

It worked. Come with me. It’s Ok... i think.

(RACHEL gently grabs the hand of her new friend and enters.. The remaining Candidates take and upload a picture of themselves in order to enter, each showing the name+face+barcode combination on the Guide to the door access control unit (AC-A*). )

.SCENE 2 (RACHEL DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE)

(Rachel walks down a passage way and the stops, she picks up an umbrella and opens it. The sound of rain, the memory of rain- there is not actual rain. Rachel continues walking through the tunnel and addressing her new friend.)

RACHEL
Once upon a time...it used to rain once in a while . Now it’s like a desert out there When was the last time it rained? Do you remember? Now there’s nothing left except hot days and  the grey whirl of machinery (???) and another day gone by. Back then we had rain and angels. We had a city and a place to call home. Now everything is one giant collage. There are no boundaries. No neighborhoods. Only endless information. We float. We drift in a sea of regret. I am lost without memory and CONNECTION

(She continues making sure the audience follows. The Fans can continue to watch on the Web via the Fan Site, or browse the Archive. )

.SCENE 3 : DRINK ME (RACHEL FURTHER DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE)

(A narrow tunnel, littered with objects and memories. Dimly lit with a pulsing light as if from the sign (SGN-A`   *) of the previous room. )



(RACHEL can’t see. She stops suddenly and points. A Candidate finds a small flashlight labeled “ TURN ME ON” and gives it to her.  Sh e turns it on and the walls flicker a bit brighter and seem to quiver. In the distance is a faint buzzing sound of machinery (via SND-AG*) They move towards it. As they get closer it resolves into the overlapping voices of thousands of recorded phone calls.)

(She speaks FAST GROWING excited.)

RACHEL
Pizza. Pasta. Salad with bread. Tortillas. Mole. Arroz con Leche. Cookies. Candy. Lots of candy. Cereal and Cranberry Juice. Pan Dulce. I’m hungry. I’m so hungry I could eat a Horse or a goat. Or a dead dog with enough meat on its bones. I haven’t had meat in ages. I haven’t had anything green in years it seems like. Everything kinda withered or disappeared but now? Now I *feel* it. I feel my tongue get wet and start to shiver. It needs food. Real food. Maybe an apple or a carrot or a. ( SHE TRIES TO DESCRIBE IT)...A *mango*. Yeah. I will eat fruit and then get healthy enough to go back home. If I can remember where it is? I’m *starving*. I’m hungry. Hungry for the sensation in my throat when I speak out loud, the feeling of warmth I get when I read, the short lived bliss I’m in when I fuck and we fall asleep together- but with who?  I forget. I can sense it but I’ve forgotten what it tastes like. What’s it like to be human? I’ve got the anatomy but I’ve forgotten how to connect. Maybe It starts with food. I need to eat... I need to eat. 

(Lightning. Darkness. Thunder. Fog. )

(Dim lights flicker through the fog. Electromechanical sounds via SND-T*. )

(The Archive leaks through. On the walls around the Candidates, via PRJ-T*, the lights become photos, video, brief archival events,  They are clearer than before everyday events that slowly begin to be interwoven with scenes of sterile and decaying views of <<THE CITY>>.  )

(The Fans see the same images on the Fan Site but the Candidates are not visible. )

(PING! A welcoming sound. The group moves towards the sound. The walls are pulled away, PING! The welomcing sound is louder and closer.  They enter the AGORA)

.ACT 2: THE AGORA. SCENE 1: FIRST CONNECTION: REUNION

(All the groups of  audience members and their travelers find themselves together in The Agora, bathed in warm and friendly light,  facing five new doors, clear Archival images on the surrounding walls via PRJ-AG*.  )

(The growing murmur is now more distinct. The voices of the Citizens can barely be made out, welcoming the GUESTS into the Archive.)

THE ARCHIVE

(on each Guide, on the web, and as a voice in the Agora)

Welcome to Transfer, <<Roshni/Citizen/etc>> 

(The Agora is surrounded by soft FOG drifting through shafts of light. Faint flickering images from the Archive spin around the space, via PRJ-AG*.)

THE ARCHIVE

(on each Guide)

Welcome. 

(THE Travelers move around the space, point to, comment on, engage the images,encourageing the tourists to do so as well. The audience and performers CAN mix freely in this open space with multiple entrances.)

THE ARCHIVE

(to the Fans)

They have arrived. 

(For the Fans, a collage/montage of memories of <<THE CITY>> via PRJ-AG* that they have never seen before, with paths to follow into the memory of the Archive and, overlaid, live cameras of the physical space (CAM-AG*).  )

(Each Traveler speaks quietly to those close to them. Perhaps each traveler speaks of a sense; taste, touch, smell, sight based on an image that flashes by and sparks a memory but the memory of these sensations are not enough. They need/want/lack the real thing now. - )

RACHEL 

(aside)

When I was a little I would eat. I ate for days. Ice-cream, soda, broccoli and toast. Eggs, bacon, quesadillas, oatmeal, cereal, nachos, and soup. It was perfect. The the heat, The spice, the the sticky,the sweet, the sharing of it all. I was full. We were whole. I need to eat to get back there again. I need to feed this hunger and desire. If only I could find a way to do this. To feed myself something more than electronic obsession.    

.SCENE 2 :  REMEMBER

EDDIE
Sheena is that you? Rachel, Rachel look it’s Sheena

RACHEL
Sheena, Sheena where did you go?

SHEENA
What?

RACHEL
We’ve been looking for you 

SHEENA
Do I know you? Do I... Rachel?.... Rachel... are you still hungry?

RACHEL
STARVING! Look. 

IMAGES start to appear fading in and out

SHEENA 
Hey I know that place!

EDDIE
Yeah! It’s ... it’s

RACHEL
Yeah right it’s.. Look over there that’s-

(She moves towards the image. It fades, she sees and moves towards another. The travelers begin to spread out and explore the images throughout the space. The audience, encouraged by the Travelers,  might also explore the Agora. THE IMAGES BEGIN TO MOVE ABOUT THE SPACE. The images they encounter seem to speed up and slow down according to the visitors proximity to the walls. )

(The TRAVELERS move about the room trying to follow the images. They encourage the audience to join them. They Continue to react to the images. They recognize some, perhaps others are images uploaded by Tourists and Fans.)

THE ARCHIVE

(via the Guides and aloud)

Here, your memories are safe TO REMEMBER

(The Fans’ view into the website has switched from five possible feeds to only the Agora (CAM-AG*), and the interface has changed, so that they feel that they are also in the Agora. )

SHEENA
Wait, 
Slow down.  
STOP IT
I don’t remember it like that
LET ME REMEMBER IT RIGHT!

(THE travelers Sheena and Eddie  have been bumping into each other trying to follow the images, Sheena grows frustrated. )

SHEENA
I’m leaving.

RACHEL
I’m staying.

FELIX
Why are you leaving?

RACHEL
SHEENA

EDDIE
You gotta stay Sheena

FELIX
Where are you going?

SHEENA
Fuck this I’m leaving.

.SCENE 3: THE CITIZENS INTERVENE

Each Candidate’s Guide lets out a PING sound

CITIZENS
We are your City. Come REMEMBER with us

(Another PING sound from their hands, pockets, purses, etc. It is answered by a similar sound behind the walls of the Agora.)

(On the walls, five digital signs (SGN-RC*) appear, above each image.  They read with the titles of the Rituals contained with in: “#bar-room #meditation”, “memories 291-300”, “#hallways #loneliness”, etc.)

THE ARCHIVE 

(to each Candidate, silently on their Guide)

Enter <<”#bar-room #meditation>>. 

CITIZENS
Remember this?

EDDIE
Look at that.

SHEENA
Wait...

FELIX
Wait for what?

RACHEL
Look at it.

(They stare at the images.)

RACHEL
Look at it.

CITIZENS
Have you ever been  there?

SHEENA
Where?

CITIZENS
There..here

SHEENA
Who are you , where are you?

EDDIE
You think we should go?

FELIX
I think we should go. (TO AUD)  You think we should go?

RACHEL
I’m starving. 

FELIX
I’m following that sound. 

RACHEL
*That smell*. I recognize that smell.

EDDIE
SHEENA?

SHEENA
Fine. I’ll go. ( TO AUD) Jut in case your  need my help.

(The Travelers, pass through slits in the walls of the Agora behind the images and below the signs. They step through into the Ritual Chambers.)

.RITUAL 1 (OF 5) EPISODE 1 (OF 3): FOREPLAY

Ritual Chambers. Insert Rituals 1-5 here. 

THE ARCHIVE 

(to each Candidate, silently on their Guide)

Simulation commencing. 

(The first Ritual Cycle is an interactive presentation of what the Archive holds, via PRJ-RC*.)

(In the Ritual, the Citizens give those transferring a taste of their world through a gently interactive but engaging and exciting reenactment of something pulled from the Archive of the City.)

(These are the "surface" memories, mostly pleasurable. And perhaps  very iconic. The Travelers (and willing Candidates) get involved in the memory and perhaps take a role in this reenactment.)

(The more the Candidates and Travelers participate, the more the Citizen become present in the space AND THE MORE THEY CAN HELP. This is a pleasurable experience, esp. for the Citizens who are now ALIVE in the memory. )

(The Fans watch one or more rituals through their websites, and can in some cases direct memory choices in the environment.  The more they interact with the website, the more present their avatar is as well. )

(During the Ritual, the audience are encouraged to participate in any way possible, but at least to take photos or video of the events, which they can upload and incorporated into the Ritual and the Archive.)

(At an appointed time (no matter what is happening) a CUE (via PRJ-RC*) signals that Episode One is over. The Simulation fades and the GUESTS exit back to the AGORA.)

.ACT 3 SCENE 1 BACK IN THE AGORA

Back in the Agora, the Travelers speak to the  Tourists/audience and now after this shared experience  expect more respond

EDDIE
You think there’s more where that came from?

FELIX
There has to be.

SHEENA
Yeah, like I was at some kinda awesome buffet.

EDDIE
And *water*!

(A LONG BEAT)

RACHEL
I could taste *everything*. I remembered things.

FELIX
Me too.

EDDIE
Like what?

(A very long beat...)

FELIX
I dunno. 

RACHEL
Like good things. Like how I learned to ride my bike. How my dad taught me how to swim. Things like that.

EDDIE
And you tasted them?

RACHEL
No.

THE ARCHIVE 

(to each Candidate, silently on their Guide)

Simulation training complete. Commence transfer for <<Yuki>>.  

(On each Guide, below their name is the picture of the Candidate that they took earlier. That is, except for those who shared their Guides with the Travelers for identification. Each of their Guides shows their name with the Traveler’s face. )

SHEENA
She means she felt full again. Like human an shit.

RACHEL
Yeah. I felt like I knew my body again. Like blood was flowing through me.

EDDIE
Blood?

RACHEL
Flowing through me!

EDDIE
I don’t like the sound of that.

FELIX
No. It makes sense. I don’t remember what that is but if it was a good feeling then it makes sense.

EDDIE
I don’t like the sound of blood. That’s never makes sense.

SHEENA
I’d rather bleed and be alive than be stuck here.

EDDIE
You were afraid before. You said this was stupid.

SHEENA
After that thing we just passed through?  I want more. 

FELIX
It felt good.

(PING! On the walls, the five digital signs appear.  )

SHEENA
It felt fantastic!

(A LOUDER PING!! This time, they read with the real names of the five Candidates who let the Travelers (like RACHEL) use their Guide for identification. )

RACHEL
It felt *real* Eddie. Come on, I wanna go and try it again, don’t you?

(Below each sign (SGN-RC*) the corresponding Traveler’s face appears.  PING!!!)
