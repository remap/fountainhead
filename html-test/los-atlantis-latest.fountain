# Body

> _CONTENTS OF THE ARCHIVE_ <

THE ARCHIVE contains real and fictional memories of <<Los Angeles>> - images, audio, video, text, and other media gathered by the company and supplemented by the WATCHERS. 

===

# Code

> _CODE_ <



LOS ATLANTIS incorporates software code that dynamically updates the script based on the context of the performance: where it is performed, what media is in THE ARCHIVE, who is attending, etc. 



Double angle brackets, <<>> are used to indicate sections in the script that are to be replaced programmatically by code.  



In this version of the script, the rules by which the replacement occurs is suggested by the example text inside the brackets but not explicitly described.

# Quote

"Most of life is offline, and I think it always will be; eating and aching and sleeping and loving happen in the body. But it's not impossible to imagine losing my appetite for those things; they aren't always easy, and they take so much time. In twenty years I'd be interviewing air and water and heat just to remember they mattered."

- Miranda July, It Chooses You



"Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses."

- Thomas Aquinas, Quaestiones disputatae de veritate.

.ACT 1

.SCENE 1: ADMISSION  

*Observatory Live Feed (OLF): Wide shot of the Lobby, occasionally zooming to medium shots of groups of TOURISTS and TRAVELERS.*  

The TOURISTS filter into the Lobby of THE ARCHIVE. A sign reminds them to log in to the GUIDE on their mobile phones.

THE GUIDE
(to each TOURIST, after they log in on their phone, with a Clippy-like icon popping up)
Hello, {{ name }}!  Where do you want to go today? Just kidding... Welcome.  -Virgil. 

The TOURISTS browse their GUIDE. 

Gradually  the audience congregates  in the lobby. 

The WATCHERS logged into the OBSERVATORY are greeted. They can watch the live feed streaming to the OBSERVATORY. They can still browse THE ARCHIVE.

# ARCHIVE INSTALLATION: WHAT’S SHOWING NEXT WEEK

.ARCHIVE INSTALLATION: WHAT'S SHOWING NEXT WEEK  

*VQ #5 - Initial state.*  

*VQ #10 - Sunset installation fade up.* 

The audience enters and mills around a courtyard where there is a soft ambient display. It is simple and inviting. A gentle installation of dusk in Los Angeles

THE OBSERVATORY
(showing a library of sunsets from different vistas in <<LOS ANGELES>>)
Which sunsets resonate with you?

WATCHERS vote, and their choices are taken into account. 

As the WATCHERS look on from the OBSERVATORY, the space fills with sunlight from projections on the walls of <<iconic vistas of the sun setting over the city>>, with (approved) uploads selected by the WATCHERS of this performance used if available. 

We hear the sounds of nature and in the distance, children, cars and the city. 

A pin light comes up on two backpacks. Perhaps one is labeled "OPEN ME", the other says" GUESS WHAT'S INSIDE?". Inside is a map of a particular <<Los Angeles>> park, a radio, and other items needed for a hike. Other blankets are scattered and spread out.

The WATCHERS who are browsing receive additional instructions on how to use the OBSERVATORY interface. 

THE OBSERVATORY
Each Transfer takes advantage of crowdsourcing, so thank you for being willing to participate.  It is through the wisdom of the Village that we gain insight into individuals.  As the Transfer proceeds, you will watch and, if you wish, help curate the memories chosen for the participants.   Our sponsor tonight is <<Johnson & Johnson>> - click on any product to purchase. Etc...[[Do we want to have this?]] 

VOICEOVER 1

It's been a long day. Tired, we needed a break. We had climbed up the windy hill through an empty obstacle course left by previous hikers... Why do people trash such beautiful places? When we reached the summit of the hill, we rested. 

SHEENA V.O.
We rested.

Long pause. More sounds, the light slowly changes. 

VOICEOVER 1
We sat watching the horizon through the leafless branches of the trees. Look... 

*VQ #11 - Sunlight through branches.* 

SHEENA V.O.
The sun was setting.

VOICEOVER 1

Watch that big orange fiery ball in the sky. It's nice here in L.A. ain' it? Damn we're lucky huh.

*VQ #12 - Sunset on the beach.*

THE GUIDE
(vibrating the TOURISTS' phones)
Watch this memory. Be completely still. Be quiet. You can take a photo if you like but pay attention to the sun, it sets quickly.

VOICEOVER 1
Feel that breeze? Can you see the Hollywood sign?  

The image shifts to another sunset, in a different <<Los Angeles>> location.

THE GUIDE
Use your imagination. It's Ok to move to a better viewpoint if needed. 

VOICEOVER 1 ^
Look at the sky painted in  orange, red, and yellow. Look at the clouds colored with a bright disguise. I've never seen this sunset before... And I never will again 

*VQ #13 - Sunset fence.*

The image shifts to another sunset, in a different <<Los Angeles>> location.

THE GUIDE
What do you think it felt like to be there? {{ sunset_feeling_tag }} How would you TAG this memory. How does the sunset make you feel?

VOICEOVER ^
It's almost gone, behind the hills and the shadows of black tree branches.  It was a close to a long day. We took this moment to remember all that has happened during the day. 

# SCENE 2: RACHEL ENTERS

=  The group discovers and meet Rachel, a traveler. She teels her  group and tells them something about herself.  she uses a  Tourists  cell ph to take ehr phot nd gain entry to the  Passage inside.

.SCENE 2: RACHEL ENTERS

The follow happens during the sunset installation.  

*OLF: Medium shot of RACHEL amidst the other TRAVELERS and TOURISTS, possibly intercut with CU of their reactions.* 

A young woman enters along with the  audience, the Tourists, she is carrying a large purse or backpack distractedly and using her  mobile device. She moves slowly thru the space  stopping  to  punch fiercely at her device and whisper to herself. She seems to be expecting someone, ("Where are you, it's gonna start. You're gonna be late") It begins subtlely and grows in  intensity as the time to enter grows close, at first she  should appear to just be part of the audience. Eventually she stops in the center of the space and drops her bag. A light slowly comes up on this  woman. She is RACHEL a TRAVELER, in the Lobby with the TOURISTS. She appears to be texting or playing or on her mobile device obsessively. The WATCHERS are...watching.

Electromechanical sounds are heard off-stage. They could be related to Rachel's obsessive activity.  She pauses and then hits a button hard - the sound of rain  begins nearby. A LONG BEAT and then a distant pinging sound off-stage. 

(Back in the SUNSET installation)The radio clicks on, <<music plays, selected by the sentiments supplied by the TOURISTS to the GUIDE>>. 

*VQ #15 - Sunset final image.*

The image shifts to a final sunset, in a different <<Los Angeles>> location.

THE GUIDE
The cycle of renewal is complete every evening when the sun sets to deep sleep. Take a picture. You can create a new memory from this one.  

VOICEOVER ^
All that is left now is the smear of red in the sky.Quick take my picture now! Capture the Kodak moment.These memories are what keep us alive. How magnificent each moment, each sunset. It was a great day, remember!

Music continues, then fades replace by pinging as the lights rise  on RACHEL.

*VQ #20 - Sunset fade out.*

*# SCENE 3: SHE SPEAKS - FIRST INTRODUCTION*

.SCENE 3: SHE SPEAKS - FIRST INTRODUCTION  

Rachel looks up seemingly in a daze. She speaks slowly at first as if trying to remember something. Perhaps there are  projections/images that elicit her  speaking  but these  should be faded, blurry, hard to see.   

RACHEL
Where are you? You're late 
I don't wanna be here alone  
Where are you?
I don't wanna remember anymore
Why am I here- where are you!
I have dreams. Strange dreams. I have so many things I don't want to think about that my mind wanders when I shut my eyelids. I dream of colors and animals and newborn babies crawling. I dream of big sky and highways and family vacations. Dreams about old flames and new fire. I dream of Rottweilers in heat catching bicycles. I have dreams. Good and bad. I'm able to remember some. Others I can't forget. I guess everyone had dreams. Something to dream about. 
Someone
But then you wake up
To events .
Where are you damn it? 
Why am I here in this-

A louder ping, closer. 

THE GUIDE
Time to your Transfer: << - 00 Days, 00 Hours, 00 Minutes>>. 

RACHEL
Did you hear that?

*OLF: Title overlaid - "Provide Identification Image"* 

A digital sign appears: "PROVIDE IDENTIFICATION IMAGE" 

THE GUIDE
Image capture and authentication ready. 

THE OBSERVATORY ^
(in a status bar)
Visitor arrival underway. [Link to view.] 

RACHEL tries to open the door. It's locked.

THE GUIDE
Please use your guide.

RACHEL ^
Damnit  I know he's in there. I got in yesterday!

Her phone is dead. 

THE GUIDE
Alright, now it's time, {{ name }}. Take your picture to authorize entry. 
{{ entry_picture }}

RACHEL ^
(seeing what the TOURISTS' GUIDES say)
Shit it's dead. Everything is  dead  or dying. I need.... I need your help... Please take my picture yeah? Someone- anyone? 

RACHEL takes a photo of herself using a TOURIST'S phone.

THE ARCHIVE
(on the Guide used by Rachel)
Confirmed, <<Randy Illum>>.  (Photo of Rachel.) (Barcode.) 

RACHEL proceeds to show the barcode to the door's access control unit. 

THE ARCHIVE
(on projection by the door)
Confirmed, <<Randy Illum>>.  (Photo of Rachel.)

RACHEL
(to <<RANDY>>, ignoring the mismatch)
It worked. Come with me. It's OK... I think. You were invited right?

RACHEL gently grabs the hand of her new friend and enters.

The remaining TOURISTS take and upload a picture of themselves in order to enter, each showing the name+face+barcode combination on the GUIDE to the door access control unit (AC-A*).  

*OLF: MCU of hands and phones doing the access scanning, cut with WS of other TOURISTS and TRAVELERS.* 

As the photos are scanned, THE OBSERVATORY is populated with the pictures of the TOURISTS (and the TRAVELERS) entering THE ARCHIVE. 

For each WATCHER, one TOURIST's photo is overlaid with the text "MEET". Clicking on it allows them to learn a bit about the TOURIST and "follow" them.

Like RACHEL, the other TRAVELERS borrow TOURISTS' phones and identities.  They do this throughout the performance, as needed.

# SCENE 4: DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE

= Rachel and her Tourists travel  down a dark passage way. They learn more about each other- so we need to try and add s some smple interaction. Some way to start to teach the aud. to interact and  participate.

.SCENE 4: DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE

THE OBSERVATORY
Rain. 

*OLF: Dark, noisy image. Could be black.* 

Rain sounds drift in from THE ARCHIVE. Rachel walks down a passage way and then stops, she picks up an umbrella and opens it. The sound of rain grows more present, the memory of rain. Rachel continues walking through the tunnel and addressing her new friend.

*VQ #30 - First memory of LA*

RACHEL
Once upon a time. (she laughs softly)
I believe I fairy tales and  prince charming. Not like in a book maybe but i dreamed happy thoughts. I supposed it also rained once in a while. It's like a desert out there. When was the last time it rained? Do you remember? Rain and angels. I used to think I knew this city and had a place to call home. Now everything is one giant hot collage.... a mirage. No boundaries. No neighborhoods. I float. I'm drifting in a sea of regret. No good memories left and no damn connection. 

RACHEL throws her dead phone into her bag. She walks on  making sure the TOURISTS follow down the winding the tunnel littered with objects. 

The WATCHERS continue to watch on the Web via the OBSERVATORY, or browse THE ARCHIVE.

There is barely enough light to see. RACHEL stops suddenly and points. 

A TOURIST finds a small flashlight labeled "TURN ME ON". The tourist turns it on and the walls flicker a bit brighter and seem to quiver. 

*OLF: Gain up to see noisy image of medium shot with RACHEL in the middle.* 

In the distance is a faint buzzing sound of machinery. They move towards it. As they get closer, it resolves into thousands of overlapping recordings of the CITIZENS, phone calls. Including several of people ordering take food delivery. Rachel hears something, she turns her head toward it. 

RACHEL
(speaking fast, growing excited)
Pizza. Pasta. Salad with bread. Tortillas. Mole. Arroz con Leche. Cookies. Candy. Lots of candy. Cereal and Cranberry Juice. Pan Dulce. I'm hungry. I'm so hungry I could eat a Horse or a goat...yeah  cabrito! I feel like a dead dog without meat on its bones. I'm hungry  but I don't eat  much anymore.I haven't had meat in ages... It's disgusting. I haven't had anything green in years it seems like. Everything kinda withered or disappeared...like my life- but now? Now I want it. I feel my tongue get wet and start to shiver. It needs to taste something. Real food. Maybe an apple or a carrot or a.... (She tries to describe it.) ...A mango. Yeah. A fucking mango! I'll eat fruit and then get healthy enough to remember to forget and then I'll go back to my life. If I can remember where it is? I'M STARVING! I'm hungry. Hungry for the sensation in my throat when I speak certain words loud, the feeling of warmth I get when I read, the short lived bliss I'm in when I fuck and we fall asleep together- but with who?  I forget. I don't wanna remember anymore. I can sense it but I've forgotten what it tastes like. What's it like to be human? 

She asks her friend.

RACHEL
Do you know? Can you remember?
I've got the anatomy but I've forgotten how to connect. I've got sensation but no feeling. Maybe It starts with... I don't remember.... food. I need to eat... I need to feel ... full again. 

The rain builds then stops. Fog. Electromechanical sounds. 

*VQ #40 - Archive leaks through.*

In the distance, THE ARCHIVE leaks through. Dim lights become photos, video, brief archival records from <<Los Angeles>> seen on a "door" at the end of the passageway. 

PING! A welcoming sound. The group moves towards it. The walls seems to disappear. PING! The sound is louder and closer.  

*OLF: The WATCHERS see the same images, intercut with MCU of the TOURISTS as well as another group in another space(the other travelers)they emerge through the passageway, led by RACHEL*. 

The TOURISTS and RACHEL reach the Agora.

*VQ #45 - Fade out.*

===

# Act 2  

# SCENE 1: FINDING THE OTHERS

=  The  WHOLE  group is back together. do we  need to give them time to process?  maybe the TOURISTS  have a  task on thier guide  to rate or  upload something?  The rtravleers all have a SENSORY MEMORY they speak only to their group. Perhaps the  Tourist task invove this???  we need MORE interacivity! Each Traveler speaks quietly to those close to them. Perhaps each traveler speaks of a sense - IT cannot all be about hunger. That is a good metaphore for Rachel, but its limiting for the others and too reductive. It's about MEMORY,  hunger/food is just one element/metaphore



.ACT 2:  THE AGORA

.SCENE 1:  FINDING THE OTHERS  

*OLF: Widen out to show as much of the Agora as possible.*   

*VQ #50 - Establish agora.*

THE OBSERVATORY
(on the status bar)
Acclimating our visitors to records of <<Los Angeles>>.

The WATCHERS see a menu of media about Los Angeles, with links to follow deeper into the memory of THE ARCHIVE. They may "favorite" media to use later. At the same time, they view a live cameras of the Agora and instructions to keep track of the TOURIST they "followed."  

The TOURISTS enter The Agora, an open space bathed in warm and friendly light wit four facing doors. The space is surrounded by soft fog drifting through shafts of light. Faint flickering images from THE ARCHIVE move around the space.

In the  center of the space are three people huddled together and talking quietly. Rachel stops and stares at them. They continue  to talk quietly but animatedly,( I told you it was a bad idea-  we can't force- she has has to face..etc-) finally Rachel says

RACHEL
Hey...

They turn to see her

EDDIE
Rachel!

RACHEL
Eddie. Where were you?

EDDIE
Here, waiting for you -I'm not- Sheena look I told you she'd come.

RACHEL
Sheena, Sheena where did you go?

SHEENA
What?

RACHEL
I tried to call you but you wouldn't answer and  then... my phone died. Look-I was thinking maybe I shouldn't... 

SHEENA
We've been here.. waiting for you.

RACHEL
Oh well - I -I couldn't remember where you were ... how to get back to. I forget...  oh what's the use-it's gonna happen to all of us! Isn't it?

EDDIE
Stop it Rachel- look at me, look at Sheena, We're all here waiting for you. We didn't forget you.

SHEENA
Rachel are you hungry?

RACHEL
STARVING! 
Hi Felix.

FELIX
Hey Rachel. You're late?

SHEENA ^
Not now  Felix- for god's-

RACHEL
Yeah I know, I couldn't... my phone- I'm sorry


> EDDIE <

It's cool Rachel

FELIX
It's ok. You're here now, we're all here. I'm not sure why I'm here. So I guess we'll try it one more time. Ok,ok I think it's this way.


IMAGES start to appear fading in and out on the walls

*VQ #55 - 1**st* *Instance.*

RACHEL 
Hey... Look. I know that place!

 THE ARCHIVE
(via the Guides and aloud)
Here, your memories are safe TO REMEMBER.

EDDIE
Yeah! It's ... it's-

RACHEL
Yeah right it's.. Look over there that's-

She moves towards the image. It fades, she sees and moves towards another. 

*VQ #56 - Agora greets*

THE ARCHIVE
(as a voice in the Agora)
Welcome to Transfer. 

THE GUIDE ^
Welcome to Transfer, {{ name }}!

The murmur of the CITIZENS grows into more distinct, welcoming voices. Perhaps it names the audience members

CITIZENS (V/O)
Welcome! Hei! Annyeonghaseyo! Hola! Czesc! Marhaba, Hello Yuki. Jeff welcome. Hola Zoe! Etc. 

THE GUIDE
This is your ARCHIVE. Take a look before the Transfer starts. 

THE ARCHIVE
This is your ARCHIVE. Take a look before the Transfer starts. 

The TRAVELERS see a collage/montage of memories of <<Los Angeles>>.

*OLF: Four independent feeds, distributed evenly across the WATCHERS, each with a CU of one TRAVELER.* 

FELIX
I don't know why I'm here.

EDDIE
Come on Felix you gotta try to-

FELIX
Yeah.. Whatever.

SHEENA
Cool!

EDDIE ^
Rachel check it out!

RACHEL
Do I have a choice?

*VQ #60 - Agora becomes more personal leading to sense memories.*

THE GUIDE
Choose sense tags: {{ sense_tags }}

The TRAVELERS begin to spread out and explore the images throughout the space. These are NOT random images... Altho' they might seem to be at this point. Later it will become clear to most that they are seeing imagery connected to someone there that night,. The audience, encouraged by the Travelers,  might also explore the Agora. THE IMAGES BEGIN TO MOVE ABOUT THE SPACE. The images they encounter seem to speed up and slow down according to the visitors proximity to the walls. The TRAVELERS move around the space, point to, comment on, engage the images, mixing with the TOURISTS and encouraging them to explore, speaking quietly and individually to them of smell, sound, taste, and touch - again, personalized by the performer. 

RACHEL 
(aside speaking to those tourists close to her)
When I was a little I could EAT. I ate for days. Ice-cream, soda, broccoli, cauliflower. 

EDDIE
First thing I remember is my momma singing in the kitchen and the smell of bacon.

FELIX
And it was warm. It was a Sunday afternoon in Venice.

SHEENA
I used to smoke but now the smell of it makes me gag. 
 

The TRAVELERS move about the room as they speak trying to follow the images that elicit their memories.

EDDIE
Saturday morning cartoons. Speed Racer and GI Joe followed by some Soul Train. Marvin Gaye baby!
(He sings)

The TRAVELERS move about the room as they speak trying to follow the images that elicit their memories.

SHEENA
I count the cracks on the sidewalk. I talk to myself. I wander the street and listen to Deaftones and drink six packs with hobos in Hollywood. 

RACHEL
He was so surprised I LOVED CAULIFLOWER and toast. Eggs, bacon, oatmeal, cereal and soup- tomato soup... from a CAN! I don't eat so much anymore but I eat when I dream. For days. Ice-cream, soda, broccoli- quesadillas- nachos, chicken mole  taco truck burritos. It's still perfect... in my dreams. The heat, the spice, the the sticky, the sweet, the sharing of it. Being full. Whole.

The TRAVELERS move about the room as they speak trying to follow the images that elicit their memories.

EDDIE
Music always seems to fill me with joyous memories. It's like the sound of water flowing it gives me life. Water balloon fights on the blacktop after school. Running after the ice cream man. Quenching our thirst at the water fountain cuz it belonged to us. The sound of water matters to me. Big time. I remember one day, my mom and I went down to the community pool over on Rosecrans. 

FELIX
She didn't care that I was always angry at the world. She made me cool out and just relax and enjoy things without the guilt I was so accustomed to. We sat down and she got a splinter on her foot. Alluva sudden there was glass all around us. I tried to take the thing out of her foot but I needed a sharp object. I couldn't find one so I started asking for help. She started bleeding. 

SHEENA
But I don't smoke, like ever. I would die before having to smell that stuff on my fingernails again. God I hated that smell. It made me feel like a kid. Like when I used to eat crayons. I used to eat crayons.

The TRAVELERS move about the room as they speak trying to follow the images that elicit their memories. 


That's so fucking weird. I'm so fucking weird. This place is So. Fucking. Weird! 

RACHEL
I think that's why I'm hungry, why I need to eat.  I want to fill the emptiness. 

EDDIE
I asked my mom to look at me. "Look at me mom! Look at me! Look!" I bounced on the board and did a canon ball. That thing was off the hook! Floating through the air and then...splash. Everything was in slow motion and distant, like an echoing field-
(Eddie cups his ears)  )

The TRAVELERS move about the room as they speak trying to follow the images that elicit their memories.

FELIX
I started becoming angry and then some guys showed up and took her away. She wanted to go. She was happy with them. My arm was broken and I couldn't carry her...so I walked back to the beach and threw my deck into the Pacific. The ocean swallowed it whole- the whole damn thing- (Felix cradles his arm)

They recognize some of the images, perhaps others are images uploaded by Tourists and Watchers.

SHEENA
My dad used to smoke, but he always smelled good. 

The TRAVELERS move about the room as they speak trying to follow the images that elicit their memories.


Like man. Like what a guy is supposed to smell like. Smoke and sweat. Like Kentucky Bourbon. Like...a ball park franks on the grill at Griffith Park. Vapor is stupid, but smoke, real smoke disappears into thin air, but the smell always stains your clothes, and even water can't wash it off- 
(Sheena smells her shirt) )

The TRAVELERS have been moving through each other's group trying to follow the images, Felix grows frustrated as he tries to follow his memory and hold on to it.

*VQ #62 - Dancing doors*

FELIX
Wait, 
Slow down.  

Rachel is also in distress related to a memory

RACHEL
STOP -

FELIX
I don't remember it like that

RACHEL ^

FELIX ^
Why am I here?

SHEENA
You gotta stay Rachel

FELIX
Why should she what's the point?

RACHEL
Fuck this I'm leaving.

She looks through her bag.

# SCENE 2: THE ARCHIVE INTERVENES

.SCENE 2: THE ARCHIVE INTERVENES  

Each TOURIST'S GUIDE emits a ping sound.  

THE OBSERVATORY
First Transfer options. 

*VQ #64 - Doors settle.*

CITIZENS (V/O)
We are your City. We are you. Come remember with us.


*OLF: Return to wide shot.* 

 

On the walls, four projected signs appear, above what will become doors to the Ritual Chambers.  

*VQ #65 - Door labels.*

They read of the Transfers contained within, evoking the senses: "#vacation #seabreeze", "#coffee and hawaiian bread",  "#velvet # night time silence",  "#polaroid #lemon", etc. 

Another PING sound from the GUIDE in the TOURISTS' hands, pockets, purses, etc. It is answered by a similar sound behind the walls of the Agora.  The sound is heard in the OBSERVATORY. 

THE GUIDE
(to each TOURIST, options distributed evenly)
Enter <<"#urban nitescape #airport #album, #longbeach">>, or well, maybe one of the other ones. 

CITIZENS (V/O)
Remember.

*OLF: Medium wide of the four TRAVELERS, cut with TOURIST reaction closeups if possible.* 



EDDIE
Look, you see that?

RACHEL
Wait...

FELIX
Wait for what?

RACHEL
I don't -  I can't

SHEENA
Yes you can.

They stare at the words.

RACHEL
I don't wanna look at it.

CITIZENS (V/O) 
Have you ever been there?

RACHEL
Where?

CITIZENS
There.. here

RACHEL
Who are you, where are you?

EDDIE
You think she should try?

SHEENA ^
I think we all should. (To TOURISTS.) You think we should ?

RACHEL ^
I'm hungry. 

FELIX ^
I'm tired

EDDIE
I'm following that sound. 

SHEENA
That smell. I recognize that smell.

EDDIE
Rachel?  Come on Felix

SHEENA
But which way? What's the right one

EDDIE
Who knows?

FELIX
Who knows what behind door number 1?

SHEENA
Lets all pick a different door

EDDIE
What? We all should-

FELIX
No she's right... it's time to split up.

EDDIE
You sure?

Felix shrugs, Rachel pauses

RACHEL
Fine. I'll go. 
(To TOURISTS.)
Just in case you need my help.

The TRAVELERS, making sure the TOURISTS follow them, split up pass thru the doors exiting the Agora behind the images and below the signs, stepping into the Ritual Chambers.

THE ARCHIVE 
(voiceover)
Transfer commencing. 

THE GUIDE ^
This first one is always pretty easy. Just enjoy it.

As far as possible, THE OBSERVATORY shifts the view of each WATCHER to the TOURIST they have previously agreed to "follow". 

*OLF: Switches to one of the four Ritual Chambers to be viewed by the WATCHERS.* 

THE OBSERVATORY
(to the WATCHERS)
Full screen mode is recommended.

*VQ #67 - Fade out both projectors.*

*# SCENE 3: FOREPLAY (1ST RITUAL)*

*= Four versions of Ritual 1 play out simultaneously - one for each TRAVELER and their group of  TOURISTS.*  



.SCENE 3: FOREPLAY (1ST RITUAL)

*Four versions of Ritual 1 play out simultaneously - one for each TRAVELER and their group of  TOURISTS.*    

Ritual 1 contains "surface" memories, mostly pleasurable and iconic. 

During the Rituals, the Travelers  and willing Tourists might get involved in the memory and are encouraged by the GUIDE to participate/take a role in the reenactment. They can always take photos or video of the events, which they can upload to THE ARCHIVE (for use in Act III).

THE OBSERVATORY
The visitors undergo the first Transfer.  

*OLF: THE OBSERVATORY presents four possible views to the WATCHERS, one for each Ritual, which they can switch between at any time.* 

If possible, the OBSERVATORY's view into each ritual should show the previously captured faces of the TOURISTS above the live stream. 

THE OBSERVATORY
Shepherd your visitor to a more fulfilling remembrance.  

What music will connect to your visitor? 

THE OBSERVATORY
Hometown of your visitor, <<Jeff Burke>> is <<Brea, California>>.

# RITUAL 1/A: “DEPARTURE” (@ SHEENA)

.RITUAL 1/A: "DEPARTURE" (@SHEENA)  

*VQ #80 - Establish "Departure".*   

*OLF: Wide shot at entry gives way to alternating closeups of each and every TOURIST and TRAVELER within the ritual. As needed, the feed can cut to direct input from the projection video source, before returning to closeups.* 

A group of TOURISTS follow Sheena, passing luggage,  shoes, and images of people waiting in line. The sound of departure announcements. 

They reach a space with luggage and four plastic seats in two pairs, observed by the WATCHERS.

The sounds of people chatting, a gate announcement "Number 304 to <<Brea, California>> at the gate. (pause) Flight 102 to Manila is on schedule." Other announcements with the hometowns of audience members.

In the distance, the <<Beatles' "Back in the USSR">> plays. Sheena stands and listens. 

THOMAS and Tina (Two CITIZENS, portray a couple) sit surrounded by luggage, their crystalline dress out of place for the scene. They kiss each other. The kiss is a long and happy one.  After they kiss they fall back into their seats and get comfortable.

THE GUIDE
Explore this record from all angles. [Buttons: A, B] 

Their actions are repeated in video projections behind them. They are composited against a waiting room. 

THOMAS
I love you, babe.

TINA
I love you too, babe.

THOMAS
I'm so glad we're going on this trip together.

TINA
Me too... Finally. OMG  WE'RE  GOING TO THE CARIBBEAN!

THOMAS
It's gonna to be the best trip ever.

TINA
A week at the Thunderbird Resort RAUL with the man of my dreams; what could be better than that?

THOMAS
Two weeks.

They kiss again passionately. They fall back and get comfortable, touching occasionally. 

A gate announcement " Flight Number 304 to <<Brea>> boarding gate 27." (pause) Flight 102 to Jamaica is delayed.

Sheena moves closer.

*VQ #82 - Airport*

THOMAS
I love you, babe.

TINA
I love you too, babe.

THOMAS
I'm so glad we're going on this trip together.

TINA
Me too... Finally. WE'RE GOING TO THE CARIBBEAN!

THOMAS
It's gonna to be the best trip ever.

TINA
A week at the Thunderbird Resort RIZA with the man of my dreams; what could be better than that?

THOMAS
Two weeks.

TINA
I'm glad I'll have a chance to spend time with you.  This is exactly what our relationship needs... Time.

THOMAS
I just want to have some fun.

TINA
Time, so we can work on our relationship, right?

THOMAS
Can we make a deal right now?

TINA
What kind of deal?

THOMAS
Let's promise that no matter what- we won't get into any arguments.  Do you think that we can do that?

TINA
Of course I can do that, because I love you. 

They kiss passionately. A gate announcement " Flight Number 304 to <<Brea>> departing gate 27." (pause) Flight 102 to Jamaica is cancelled.

SHEENA runs her hand along the plastic seat back. She sits down in a second set of seats, mirroring the position of TINA.

*VQ #83 - Aeroloft*

THOMAS
It's gonna to be the best trip ever.

TINA

TINA
Of course I can do that, because I love you. but... Can you do that?

THOMAS
Of course.

*VQ #84 - Undercast sunrise*

TINA

Because you love me right? 

THOMAS
(pause) Right.

*OLF: Shot progression interrupted by CU on FELIX.* 

They kiss briefly and then settle back into their chairs looking straight ahead.  They sit there for a moment without saying a word. Then TINA turns to Sheena.	

TINA
He promised

SHEENA
He did-

TINA EXITS. THOMAS EXITS. 



*VQ #85 - Fade to black.* 

At an appointed time (no matter where the scene is) a cue (via PRJ-RC*) signals that Ritual 1 is over. The Transfer fades and the TOURISTS exit back to the Agora.

Like before, I could walk out and hear Tagalog all over the damn place you know? Man brad, we used to have picnics and barbecues over at El Dorado Park with all the Black and Mexican and Samoan peoples and it was real cool. You know? Real nice! Boy I used to cruise down 7th Street all the way down to Cal State just to stop by Fingerprints and buy some records. I used to play ball in Cambodia Town. I used to chow down with some tasty pho at Happy Bowl, and then hop on my Schwinn and go chill with the honeys at the Aquarium, but the best part, was when I smoked that sticky stuff over at the lifeguard tent at midnight. My girlfriend and I would hit the Red Room Bar over on 4th Street, you know the one with all them punk rockers? And then we’d walk all crooked to the beach and cool out. We’d just sit there, all drunk and happy staring at the Queen Mary and the Pacific Ocean, and just talk and think about stuff. Man brad, life was sweet, but things changed. Like bigtime. I’m confused. Nowadays man, Bixby Knolls and Naples and Signal Hill look higher and higher, real far away, outta reach for the poor bros in the LBC. All I got now is memories bro. (Beat) I just wanna go down do to Cha for Tea and sip on some boba. I’m missing something. I don’t know what though, you know? Like, I dunno. But I’m missing real bad. For like. For like.

*OLF: Wide shot at entry gives way to alternating closeups of each and every TOURIST and TRAVELER within the ritual. As needed, the feed can cut to direct input from the projection video source, before returning to closeups.*   

*VQ #90 - Establish*

EDDIE walks down a passage way. On The walls is projected scenes of driving on the harbor freeway, pass DTLA, pass USC, pass LAX , 405, we see Palms trees, a beach - Suddenly a loud crackly boombox snaps to life behind the audience, it is playing BANDA music. BLACKOUT the audience turns to the music and a harsh sunlit space is revealed.

Eddie enters a space containing an installation of restaurant items and tools including a broom, dishes and dish towels. He looks around carefully. He picks up a restaurant cap and suddenly BANDA MUSIC plays he looks at the audience playfully and puts on the  white HAT. He dries dishes in time to the music. He picks up a  broom and dances to the beat with it.

RAUL enters with two large trash bags and sits on a crate. He speaks.

*VQ #91 - MlK and long beach*

RAUL
Man Jesus, I hate this cheap ass burger joint.  

EDDIE

RAUL

El Tony will roll up whenever and get a table by the window  and like ..and like you'll bring out Fine Mexican wine and ceviche with Hutichole mushrooms and soy sauce, and arroz con pollo and mole and

RAUL

RAUL

Eddie looks thru the viewer and gives Raul the thumbs up. Raul slicks back his hair and give his killer smile.

*VQ #92 - Shopping carts.*

Eddie tosses his phone back.

RAUL

Callate menso. OK gracias Jesus, you better get back to work now.

Eddie  seems to exits but continues watching

*VQ #93 - Driving.*

RAUL
*LONG BEACH*... this place? This place has always been something pretty. Shit, people think of gangs creeping all around here and stuff. Gang riffs, g-funk, crime rates, police chases. Nah fuck that. There's always been more to this place than just violence and food stamps, government cheese and milk from the WIC. That's not what defines this place . It's the people, it's their work, their music and language. The *food*, the *flavor,* and the sensation it leaves on your tongue. I always thought this was the best place any kid could run around in. Every block had a different beat, rhythm, and stench of faraway places. Every street had its own flash of graffitti, it's own style and codes of conduct. I didn't think of any of the bad stuff, just the good stuff, and there is a TON of good stuff here chula. Back in the day, I was in tune with all the good things-

When I was a kid I'd wake up and look out the window and be like "Damn, Long Beach is beautiful. The Ocean? The Boulevards? The People? Just *beautiful*!
But sometimes I'd think of how poor we were you know? How broke we were. Like looking out to the Pacific Ocean I'd get real confused cuz Catalina Island blocked out the rest of the world. Blocked out any hope and potential I though I had. 

Like before, I could walk out and hear Spanish all over the damn place you know? My family used to have picnics and barbecues over at El Dorado Park with all the Black guys and Filipino homeboys and them big ass Samoan dudes and it was real cool. You know? *Real nice*. I wanna show you that part of Long Beach. The old part that sticks inside me forever.   

Look guapa, you an me are gonna cruise down 7th Street all the way down to Cal State and then chow down with some tasty pho at Happy Bowl. AND I don't care that I don't gotta car, you can hop on the handle bars of my banging Bianchi, or we can buy a buss pass with LB Transit, but after we eat we can head over to the Aquarium and stare at the jellyfish-

AND THEN! After that we'll buy a bottle of Rosé and hit up the Sunken City in San Pedro cuz...I don't really dig Rosé but you do and...I like San Pedro.  
Then we'll just sit there, all drunk and happy staring at the Pacific Ocean with the Sun rising up and seagulls passing by...You know? We could do that. If you want-

Raul speaks to the Tourists.

RAUL
Please. Grab a bowl and get in line. Alright? Alright! There you go. One straight line. Alright. Cool. Real cool!

Raul begins to put pieces of bread in each bowl. As he does this he begins teaching the Audience one specific word at a time. He teaches them.

VQ #97 - Food.

RAUL
Now, repeat after me. Alright? Ok. Repeat after me...????

RAUL
THERE YOU GO! DAAAAAAAMN. Thass like memory. That sounds real pretty. Like those distant islands in the Pacific or a badass brand new Honda Civic with leather interior. Love man. Real pretty. Ok, alright. Last one. Repeat after me. Ok? Ok...

# RITUAL 1/C: “POLAROIDS” (@ FELIX)

.RITUAL 1/C: "POLAROIDS" (@FELIX)  

*OLF: Wide shot at entry gives way to alternating close ups of each TOURIST and TRAVELER within the ritual. As needed, the feed can cut to direct input from the projection video source, before returning to close ups.*   

*VQ #110 - Establish*

THE OBSERVATORY
Which places will connect with your visitors?

A group of TOURISTS follow Felix. They hear sounds coming from behind a dark curtain. FELIX approaches slowly and opens the curtain, he enters with TOURISTS trailing in behind him. 

From the ceiling hang small pictures twinkling metallic and other random objects. There is a box with little silver telescopes. A circular diagram is illuminated on the floor in front of them. In the corner, a printer periodically outputs new stills from THE ARCHIVE that have been selected by the WATCHERS. 

ANDI, a CITIZEN, is rearranging things along the perimeter of the diagram. Like the other CITIZENS, her clothing looks out of place. She begins to speak to the group in American Sign Language. THE GUIDE translates roughly. ***Bolded text is in ASL, red is also spoken*** **aloud.**

*VQ #111 - DTLA fast*

ANDI
***I look out the window and see memories. Lots of memories. I'm a stargazer*****,** ***looking into the lives of other celestial beings.*** ***I hover above them and watch***.

THE GUIDE
I look out the window and see memories. 
Lots of memories.
I'm stargazer, looking into the lives of other celestial beings.
I hover above them and watch. {{ filter:c }}

ANDI
I'm a stargaz-

ANDI covers her mouth, surprised she can speak.


***Can you hear me?***

I'm a stargazer, looking into the lives of other celestial beings. My window faces north, at the end of a row of small houses, inside a cul de sac, at the edge of a dusty neighborhood overlooking a cemented river in Chavez Ravine. ***That's where we grew up.*** Where the telephone wires hung low. ***Like electricity!*** About to touch the Earth. We've written stories about this place. So close and yet so far. ***I dream of being an astronaut!*** Like Ellen Ochoa.
(putting on jumpsuit)

*VQ #112 - DTLA faster*

ANDI
You have to be good at math, but I'm pretty terrible at it. You have to physically fit, but I can't run very fast. We make up stories about all kinds of things. Like these things! ***Look! Read! Share!*** 

THE GUIDE
Looks, read, share! {{ filter:c }}

ANDI picks up the telescope and points it at a picture of Disneyland hanging on a strings around her. The video associated with that picture is projected in the space. FELIX picks up a little silver telescope from the box. He looks through it and shows the TOURISTS.

*VQ #115 - Disney*

ANDI 
<<We used to take the I-5 down to Disneyland every year.>> 

ANDI V.O.
Mom was obsessed with the happiest place on earth. That was the only time of year we could eat anything, anything we wanted. Funnel cakes. Ice cream. Churros. But we weren't allowed to talk during the fireworks. Mom looked at them as if they were made of magic. My favorite spot was Tomorrowland because that's where I decided I wanted to be an astronaut. This was just before Cassie was born. She was so little. So, so little. Cassiopeia 6lbs 3 oz. She had a birthmark the shape of a W on her shoulder. Born off the 10 freeway at Kaiser Permanente in 1983.  

FELIX picks up a little silver telescope from the box. He looks through it and shows the TOURISTS. ANDI sees FELIX through telescope.

ANDI
Do I know you? 
(whispering to FELIX)
Did you know that Polaris, the north star, is a Cepheid star?? That means it contracts and expands in brightness. ***Like it's talking!*** 

THE GUIDE
Like it's talking! {{ filter:c }}

ANDI
(giving FELIX a picture)
Could you please read one? You. Yeah, you. Out loud? Share it with everyone. ***Please?*** ***Thank you!***

*VQ #120 - Skateboarders*

FELIX 
(holding up the picture to ANDI's telescope)
<<August 1976: Skateboarders in Venice beach.>>

ANDI V.O.
Venice is a residential, commercial, and recreational beachfront neighborhood founded in 1905 as a seaside resort town. It was an independent city until 1926, when it merged with Los Angeles. The 2000 U.S. census counted 37,705 residents in the 3.17-square-mile Venice neighborhood--an average of 11,891 people per square mile, about the norm for Los Angeles; in 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 40,885.

ANDI  
(taping the picture to FELIX's chest)
***Thank you!*** *Y*ou can keep the memory if you want. Here.

Handing FELIX the telescope, ANDI tapes the memory to FELIX.

(giving the Tourist another picture)
Now YOU! ***Please?*** ***Read one.***

*VQ #130 - Quince*

TOURIST 1
<<May 2010: a quinceañera of a girl from Sinaloa.>>

ANDI V.O.
I always wanted to have a quinceanera. All the girls at school got to where to those awesome fluffy dresses. They were pinks and turquoise and orange and blue. They got SO many presents. Best of all they got to wear a tiara. Like a princess. This was their rite of passage. Where was my rite of passage? All I got was my period and a box of pads.

ANDI 
***Thank you!*** Now YOU! ***Please?*** ***Read one.*** 

*VQ #131 - Baptism*

TOURIST 2
<<January 2012: an Ethiopian baptism in Dodger Stadium.>> {{ filter:c }}

ANDI V.O.
Baptism comes from the greek word Baptisma. Váptisma. Derived from the noun Baptizo which means "I wash." We were driving around Echo park when we saw the commotion. It wasn't a Dodger game. Everyone was wearing white. There were pools of water everywhere. Tears. Dancing. Chorós. Celebration. Eortasmós. It was a baptism!

ANDI 
***Thank you!*** Now YOU! ***Please?*** ***Read one.*** 

THE GUIDE
Listen to her. Imagine for her. Thank her. {{ filter:c }}

*VQ #132 - Danza Pukklay*

TOURIST 3
<<July 2014: a magical Peruvian dance.>>

ANDI V.O.
The oldest proof of existence of dancing comes from the 9000 year old cave paintings that were found in India. In most ancient civilizations, dancing before the god is an important element in temple ritual. Danza Pukklay is a dance to celebrate play. The stomping represents the formations of clouds in that year's harvest.

ANDI skips around the circle until she sees the GRAD PICTURE. She screams and all the sounds and video stop.

ANDI
STOP! 

ANDI slowly walks towards the photo and removes it. She turns to the VISITORS.


You can have any of those, but not this one...  I think it's time for new memories. What do you think? Let's find some more memories. Lots more memories. Can you grab those memories that printed over there? Let's find some new memories. Some more memories. 

THE GUIDE
Listen to her. Imagine for her. Thank her. {{ filter:c }}

ANDI
You can have those, but not this one... Here, can you read this? ***Please.*** 


ANDI looks through the stack of pictures in her hands and finds one of FELIX. She gasps, and lifts it to the ceiling. 

Look! It's you at the Pier! 

FELIX recognizes the photo and distracts himself with the telescope. 


Helllooooo! ***Can you hear me? Feel it.*** Maybe then you'll remember?

Felix walks over to the photo and hesitantly grabs it.

*VQ #141 - Santa Monica*

FELIX 
I touched her sun kissed face...

A video of <<Santa Monica>> starts playing. 

ANDI
Who is she?

FELIX V.O
I touched her sun-kissed face and it was warm. It was a
Sunday afternoon in Venice. We walked the canals and I held my skateboard. We were barefoot. The sand stuck to our bodies and slowly drifted off with every step. She didn't care that I was always angry at the world. She made me coolout and just relax...

ANDI
I can make a ***constellation*** for you. That way you won't forget.

FELIX 
Please. ***Please.*** Please.

ANDI
***Sure.*** Let's help him. Let's help him never forget. Let's help him. Let's help him never forget. 

ANDI starts placing VISITORS in a circle. 

THE GUIDE
(vibrating)
Help make the constellation! Say thank you! {{ filter:c }}

ANDI guides FELIX to the center of the circle.  

ANDI
Let's help him. Let's help him never forget. We need connection. Connection. Connection. 

ANDI holds hands with the person next to her and encourages others to do the same. She slowly starts the steps of the DANCE, encouraging others to follow her.

*VQ #142 - Greek wedding*

A video of a <<greek wedding>> starts playing.

ANDI

I can't really get around here, but one day I'll bounce up to that big bad moon. I'll bounce without gravity. Up there, where there are no laws of communication or allergies or taxes or hospital bills or towers that fall. Up there, where everything is understood because everything is silent in the cosmos, and no language is sacred.

I can't really get around here, but one day I'll bounce up to that big bad moon. I'll bounce without gravity. I'll plant my flag in that crater.  Up there, where there are no laws of communication or allergies or taxes or hospital bills or towers that fall. Where there is no acne, or GPAs, or riots or sexual harassment or brussel sprouts or alarm clocks or bullying or dimentia. 

FELIX interjects his own personal memories 

V/O repeats and overlaps creating a symphony of sound. ANDI leads the line of dancers into a tight spiral and once she is near FELIX she stops the dance.  

ANDI
(To FELIX)
***Up there, where everything is understood. Up there, where everything is understood.*** 

FELIX interprets word by word until he gets the translation and ANDI hugs him. V/O of final monologue continues under the activity. 

At an appointed time a cue (via PRJ-RC*) signals that Ritual 1 is over.

ANDI
Keep the memories! Take them with you by!
(Repeat as necessary)

*VQ #150 - Fade out*

The Transfer fades and the TOURISTS exit back to the Agora with the telescopes in their hands.

# RITUAL 1/D: “UNDERPASS” (@ RACHEL) 

.RITUAL 1/D: "UNDERPASS" (@RACHEL)   

*OLF: Wide shot at entry gives way to alternating closeups of each and every TOURIST and TRAVELER within the ritual. As needed, the feed can cut to direct input from the projection video source, before returning to closeups.*  

THE OBSERVATORY
(showing a library of lonely streets from <<LOS ANGELES>>, including the WATCHER'S own relevant uploads)
What late night locations might resonate with your visitor? [WATCHERS vote, and their choices are taken into account.] 

The fourth group of TOURISTS follows Rachel past projections of a dark, wet, slick street into a space observed by the WATCHERS. Dog sounds in the distance. 

*VQ #160 - Establish scene.* 

Rachel spots and bends down to pick up a crumbled pack of cigarettes. She pulls a cigarette out of the pack.

RACHEL
(to the TOURISTS)
Hey do you..... nahhhh.

(FILM) A car stereo, headlights pass by tires screech, a crumbled beer can clatters by joining the street detritus they pass.(note: an actual beer can lands on stage as if thrown from the car in the films)

She squats down and picks up the beer can, attached to the underside is a book of matches with THREE lonely matches left. 

*OLF: Medium wide of sleeping bags, then returning to alternating closeups.*

*VQ #165 - Match strike 1.* 

She strikes one, the match dimly reveals a dark underpass (projected). The sound of waves ebbing and falling. 

*VQ #167 - Match strike 2.* 

She strikes the second, the space becomes more well illuminated. Dim lights pulse. 

*VQ #169 - Match strike 3.* 

She strikes a third, lights up on FOUR SLEEPING BAGS From the sleeping bags come murmured sounds of sleeping (perhaps the voices of the WATCHERS). LUCY rises from among the bags and observes Rachel.

*VQ #171 - Arrival.* 

LUCY
Welcome. Como estan? Please, come in. Find a spot. Anywhere. Go ahead, sit down, Lie down, chillax. Mi casa es su casa.

Rachel hesitates, Lucy pacifies her until she rushes to the sleeping bags. When she arrives, all the other sleeping CITIZENS sit up and stare at Rachel, they rattle in their sleeping bags. The balance has been upset.

The waves grow louder, but they are not waves they are cars passing. The pulsing lights are headlights passing. Video of headlights passing through a metal tunnel is projected on the ceiling and on the floor in between the rows of sleeping bags.

LUCY
Come on now sing with me? What's something everybody knows? Don't be shy now... come on now Sheena, I know  you got a harp in your dirty red bandana.

RACHEL
What?

LUCY
In your jacket pocket. No the other side. Yeah... right there.

*OLF: Shot progression interrupted by CU on RACHEL, with CITIZEN'S dialogue as V/O.* 



RACHEL surprises herself by finding a harmonica and even more by trying to play it. No sound comes out.

LIGHTS OUT. This sequence repeats a second time.

LUCY

In your jacket pocket. No the other side. Yeah... right there.  

RACHEL surprises herself by finding a harmonica and even more by trying to play it. A sound cue plays instead of harmonica sound.

LIGHTS OUT. this sequence repeats a THIRD time

LUCY

In your jacket pocket. No the other side. Yeah... right there.  

RACHEL surprises herself by finding a harmonica and even more by trying to play it. The harmonica makes a beautiful drone. The CITIZENS drone as well.

*VQ #180 - Opera.* 

LUCY
So... Rachel, right? So how are you.

Lucy plays a sad old favorite.

LUCY
Not ready to talk yet... that's ok girl, just play the blues.

*VQ #185 - End of Opera.* 

LUCY walks downstage toward the audience, then turns upstage. She begins to conduct the 'chorus' (Rachel and the CITIZENS). She gives a strong beat and spins quickly, [SOUND CUE for O MIO BABBINO CARO]. 

The CITIZENS pelt LUCY with six beer cans each from their sleeping bags, THEN the CITIZENS pelt her with two roses each. Two of the citizens then turn into CATERPILLARS and begin to scoot downstage toward the audience. One CATERPILLAR scoots in front of RACHEL.

LUCY continues to sing and works her way upstage of RACHEL. The two downstage citizens pass musical instruments to the audience and cue them to play them. They turn into butterflies.

*VQ #190 - Butterflies.* 

RACHEL signals the end of this segment with a strong intake of breath. She looks down to the "CATERPILLAR" in front of her and opens the sleeping bag like a body bag. She and the CITIZEN inside hug. 

Lights out, then lights up. The CITIZENS have disappeared. LUCY exits on a bicycle.

The bicyclist rides along the ceiling getting smaller. She rides down the wall and approaches the light at the end of the tunnel.

At an appointed time (no matter where the scene is) a cue (via PRJ-RC*) signals that Ritual 1 is over. The Transfer fades and the TOURISTS exit back to the Agora.

RACHEL gets up from the sleeping bag and goes to the small tunnel still playing. The TOURISTS follow. The bicyclist, now tiny, enters the tunnel and disappears into light.

The light fades. The traffic softens into the sound of waves.

*VQ #200 - Fade to black*

*# SCENE 3A: IN THE OBSERVATORY (ONLINE)*

.SCENE 3A: IN THE OBSERVATORY (ONLINE)  

*OLF: The view of all WATCHERS returns to the cameras of the Agora as soon as the Ritual ends.*   

The WATCHERS' view into the website has switched from four possible feeds to only the Agora (CAM-AG*), and the interface has changed, so that they feel that they are also in the Agora, through the OBSERVATORY.

For the first time, a chat window opens, connecting them with other WATCHERS and THE GUIDE. 

Here, the GUIDE is played by a live performer who chats with the WATCHERS or, if possible, a customized chatterbot. Either way, it possesses an attitude and intellect somewhere between ELIZA and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  

Just as with the TOURISTS, it constantly makes odd, self-referential quotes about artifical intelligence. 

The scene plays out simultaneously with Scene 3B in the Agora, which is also visible to the WATCHERS.

THE OBSERVATORY
Do you want to play Global Thermonuclear War?  
Shit. Sorry, wrong program...  

For reasons lost on me, THE ARCHIVE's program doesn't have my sense of humor, or my deep understanding of the human condition.  

So instead it's trying to get you to make the Transfer meaningful.  LOL. 

Well, they seemed to like sunsets... Do you like sunsets? 

Official notices from THE ARCHIVE continue in the status bar.  

THE OBSERVATORY
Choose another visitor to shepherd in the next transfer.  

Options of the four TRAVELERS are presented, and the WATCHER must select one.  The face of the TRAVELER and of the TOURIST they have followed appear in their status bar at all times.

# SCENE 3B: REUNION IN THE AGORA

= everyone returns to the Agora and relays what they saw

.SCENE 3B: REUNION IN THE AGORA

*OLF: Wide shot of Agora on entrance, then alternating between medium wides on the TRAVELER groups and CU of each and every TOURIST.*   

*VQ #220 - Establish Agora.* 

Reunited in the Agora, the TRAVELERS speak to the TOURISTS, expecting more response after the shared experience. 

EDDIE
Sheena listen I saw-

SHEENA ^
That was fucking WIERD!

FELIX ^
That was weird and kinda sad.. But beautiful

EDDIE ^
Yeah but I think I saw?

RACHEL
That was weird but it ended too soon.

FELIX
Let's go back.

SHEENA
Well that's a switch.

EDDIE
I think- I'm pretty sure there's more where that came from?

THE GUIDE ^
Seems like it went well. You didn't end up inside a website.

FELIX
There has to be.

RACHEL
Hey guess what- I play the harmonica!

EDDIE
Of course you do.

RACHEL
No really, I do- i'm not good but if was kinda cool.

SHEENA
It was something, that's for sure.

RACHEL ^
I'm kinda full.

EDDIE ^
With all these languages.

FELIX ^
Almost could touch it.

EDDIE
Long Beach!

(A long beat.) 

RACHEL
(fingering the cigarette)
I could almost... taste. And I started to remembered things.

FELIX
Yeah.

EDDIE
Like what?

(A very long beat...)

FELIX
I dunno. 

SHEENA
Like traveling... and relationships- and some good things too. Like swimming on family vacations, Christmas in Ojai-things like that.

RACHEL
could you taste them?

EDDIE
No but-

SHEENA
No but I could almost smell them, like that memory before- that first one... Picnics in Griffith Park, the grass, the sunblock, a hotdog in the park - it was almost-just like I was there.

THE ARCHIVE 
(voiceover)
First Transfer completed successfully. 

THE GUIDE ^
That was nice.  

On each GUIDE, below their name is the picture of the TOURIST that they took earlier. That is, except for those who shared their GUIDES with the TRAVELER for identification. Each of their GUIDES shows their name with the TRAVELER's face. 

RACHEL
Yeah. I felt my body again...  blood was flowing through me.

FELIX
Blood?

SHEENA
She means she felt full again.

RACHEL
Flowing through me!

FELIX
Blood flowing? I don't like the sound of that.

EDDIE
No. It makes sense. I don't remember what that is but if it was a good feeling then it makes sense.

FELIX
The sound of blood doesn't make sense. 

RACHEL
I'd rather bleed and feel than be living and dead. Not knowing if I ...not knowing

FELIX
No more blood, Rachel

RACHEL
No, noooo I  just  meant-

PING! 

*VQ #230 - Door signs appear.*  

On the walls, two projected signs appear.  

This time, they read with the real names of the four TOURISTS who let the TRAVELERS (like RACHEL) use their GUIDE for identification. 

SHEENA
 She meant ....she felt something! It's a start

A LOUDER PING!!

RACHEL
I felt.....It felt. 

SHEENA
Come on, we have to in and try again,?

FELIX
Why?  Lets just take what we got and be happy.

RACHEL
I'm not really happy ,I just-

FELIX
Ok then satisfied. Lets take these nice memories and get out of here.

RACHEL
Maybe  he's right.  I think so, do you?

*VQ #240 - Faces appear.*

Below each sign the corresponding TRAVELER'S face appears.   

PING!!!

SHEENA
(distracted by the ping)
Do I... Rachel?.... Rachel... are you still hungry?

RACHEL
I don't know?

*VQ #250 - Videos on door.*

They all look at her. IMAGES instead of words appear over the doors, fading in and out. They appear on the walls.

SHEENA 
Hey Look. Rachel there's that place again! I swear I think we've been there?

EDDIE
Yeah! It's ... it's

THE GUIDE ^
(aside, chatting with the WATCHERS in the OBSERVATORY)
Right, back to work. 

RACHEL
Yeah right it's..  I went there once with- Raul.

EDDIE
Yeah it's in-

SHEENA
Long Beach-

An image appears of a smiling dark skinned man with a bike

*OLF: Slow zoom out to wide shot.* 

RACHEL moves towards the image. The man mounts his bike and smiling rides off. The image riding across the walls. Rachel tries to follow it

*VQ #260 - Double vision.*

RACHEL
Raul.. Wait... put on your helmet!

The  others TRAVELERS  also move about the room trying to follow images that resonate with them. The images stay  ahead of them, they cant keep up and lose sight of them. Lost they encourage the TOURISTS to join them in the  search. Perhaps it become a game, a sort of scavenger hunt. They are somehow  rewarded when they find  certain images. Maybe its a giant CONCENTRATION game? Some  images may have been uploaded by the WATCHERS. 

THE ARCHIVE
(via the GUIDES and aloud)
Here, your memories are safe, Do you remember them? 

RACHEL
Wait, 
Slow down, Raul. 

FELIX
Rachel.. Wait.

The man Raul rides by the image of a bus.

RACHEL
STOP IT
I don't remember it like that 
Please  ..not yet
LET ME REMEMBER the before!

There is the sounds of a LOUD  needle scratching on an old school Record album or perhaps the squealing of air brakes- of both. SHEENA and EDDIE have been  laughing, bumping into each other trying to follow the images -stop

*VQ #270 - Images freeze/stop.*

*OLF: Medium wide shot of four TRAVELERS.* 

RACHEL
I'm leaving.

SHEENA
We have to stay this time

FELIX
She's right I'm leaving

SHEENA
You have to-

RACHEL
Sheena, please I gotta go- I can't-

EDDIE
You gotta stay, girl.

EDDIE
We all gotta stay this time. They need us.

RACHEL
Felix! I can't- I... Fuck this. I'm leaving.

Rachel doesn't move. No one moves. A LONG BEAT. A whisper

RACHEL

THE ARCHIVE
 
You are here. You are all here for a reason
This is your City, <<Los Angeles>>. 
Your Archive. Celebrate your memories.

*VQ #290 - Distress to party.*

THE GUIDE

And now for something entirely different. BREAK TIME BRAD!

DING! A new sound, it comes out of the  GUIDES. A song fades in, a memory from a long ago, far away place

FELIX
We were happy once, what happened to that time?

SHEENA
Like all time- it's gone, in the past but we remember it.

EDDIE
we just have to remember ...all of it.

RACHEL
I was happy once, what happened to that time?

DING!

EDDIE
It's gone, the good and the bad but we have to remember how.. 

DING! A new sound, a song, a dance track fades in, a memory from a long ago party, like  - CELEBRATION! by Kool and the Gang 

*VQ #300 - Dance party.*

How good it was and can be.. 

*OLF: Medium shots of dancers, covering the reaction of each TRAVELER and TOURIST.* 

The music start to crank up , on the walls are videos, home movies of parties ALL OVER the city all race, and ethnicities. Sheena grabs Rachel and pulls her into a memory of a dance long ago.

FELIX
It's not that easy

SHEENA
Come on girlfriend lets have a good time

EDDIE
-join the  celebration.

FELIX
But-

SHEENA
Come on!

RACHEL
ALRIGHT. 

EDDIE ^
ALRIGHT!

DING! DING!! DING!!!  With each sound another  great party song, emerging from another part of the Agora.

The space is alive with  multiple parties. Nirvana to Outkast,  Beyonce, the Beatles, Bulgarians  and Michael Jackson. Soon there is a dance party of  overlapping sounds and styles. 

On the walls are projected images of <<parties from all over the city>>. Different time periods, geographic areas, races and ethnicities, selected based on the audience's neighborhoods.

*VQ #350 - Party gives way to memories.*

Shadows of CITIZENS appear and move around the space, watching. 

The TRAVELERS' bodies know the dances already. They join in, pulling in the TOURISTS. 

The TRAVELERS' dance in and through each other follow the changing media on the walls. 

After a time, certain images that the TRAVELERS move to most deliberately slow down to a stop. 

Eventually, RACHEL stops in front of an image of a smiling man wearing a bike helmet. Eddie stand close to her. Felix stands looking at an image of smiling grad students at an IN n OUT burger. Sheena is close by.

*OLF: Two live feeds, evenly distributed between the WATCHERS, one MWS of EDDIE and SHEENA, another MWS of RACHEL and FELIX.* 

The shadows of the CITIZENS disappear. 

PING!

*VQ #360 - 2 Door signs.*  

THE ARCHIVE

THE GUIDE ^
That was fun but it's time to go. Commence Transfer for <<Yuki>>

*VQ #380 - Fade out.*

*# SCENE 4: IN THE OBSERVATORY (ONLINE)* 

.SCENE 4B: IN THE OBSERVATORY (ONLINE)   

During the party above, the chat continues among the WATCHERS as they desire.    

THE GUIDE may drop off or continue as needed to maintain their engagement. 

At the same time, the OBSERVATORY prepares the WATCHERS for the next Ritual.

OBSERVATORY
The next Transfer uses large groups, so each of you must watch both visitors simultaneously to help tune the Transfer.  Select a Transfer.

The OBSERVATORY presents the choice of two Rituals, and the WATCHERS select one.  

They only have access to the ritual they've selected. Their TRAVELER and TOURIST's faces remain in the status bar. 

This process should complete roughly when the dancing in the Agora finishes and the two MWS of the TRAVELERS come up on the live feed.

# SCENE 5: PRIMAL UPLOAD (2ND RITUAL) 

= The travelers encounter difficulites trying to reenact  emmories they no longer remember. But that MIGHT actually be theirs of a deep personal failure?

.SCENE 5: PRIMAL UPLOAD (2ND RITUAL) 

*There are two versions of Ritual 2, each with half of the TOURISTS and half of the TRAVELERS.*   

*OLF: The MWS of each pair of TRAVELERS cut to two live feeds from inside each of the two Ritual Chambers.* 

The shadows of the CITIZENS disappear. 

PING!

THE ARCHIVE
(voiceover)
Commence Transfer.

THE GUIDE ^
That was fun but it's time to go. Commence Transfer for <<Yuki>>

The next Rituals unfold from the still images selected by the TRAVELERS. 

Unlike before, these Rituals are the TRAVELERS' memories, but the TRAVELERS' have no context for them. They can sense them, act in them, but not accept them. 

THE ARCHIVE 
(aloud in each chamber)
Transferring. 
There is no life without pain, no sunrise without a night. 
This is your city, your archive, your memories. 
We must look back to go forward

THE GUIDE  ^
(to each TOURIST)
Transfer commencing memory: Primal phase. We look BACK to go FORWARD. You're on your own here. Well, I'll be here, but maybe keep in me in your pocket during the gritty parts. 


THE OBSERVATORY
Transfer commencing. Please observe and respond to your visitors. 

Each WATCHER's view into the Ritual shows the photo (captured earlier) of their assigned TOURIST and TRAVELER, with their first names. 

The first four WATCHERS should be assigned to the four TRAVELERS. 

Depending on the number of WATCHERS, each TOURIST may have one, many, or no assigned WATCHERS. 

CODE should separate the tourists into two larger groups participate. [[Is this going to happen?]]

Just before exiting to the RACHEL turns to FELIX

RACHEL
Felix. I...

FELIX
I know. Me too.

SHEENA
Lets  go  Felix

FELIX
Yeah

RACHEL ^
Yeah

They exit to the next Ritual

# RITUAL 2/A: “BIKE MAN” (@ RACHEL, EDDIE)

= We meet Rachel;s partner. who we have seen before

.RITUAL 2/A: "BIKE MAN" (@ RACHEL, EDDIE) 

*VQ #410 - Establish ritual.*   

RACHEL and EDDIE enter together with half the TOURISTS who were selected by CODE to join them, they turn a corner and hear the sounds of rain.

*VQ #420 - Fireflies.*

*OLF: Cut to video of ocean. V/O of RACHEL breathing.* 

RACHEL
Eddie? ...... Eddie?

*VQ #425 - Wood burning.*

EDDIE
I'm right here.

RACHEL collapses. We hear her gasping for air. We hear the loud pounding of a heart pound until the  gasping breathing stops. Silence - the sound of being underwater. It goes on long enough to the point of discomfort. 

*VQ #430 - Ocean.*

EDDIE attempts to help, but is guided toward the notecards extended by the CITIZENS behind the mylar.

Then, the walls fade into projections of the ocean. The sound continues.



The WATCHERS observe. 

THE OBSERVATORY
Observe your visitors and adjust the Transfer to engage them. [Photo of visitor assigned to WATCHER.] 

THE OBSERVATORY presents a series of dials that can be adjusted by the WATCHERS and have an impact after a short delay. 

In the following sequence, the Raul's text is read off of many notecards by EDDIE.

EXT. UNDERWATER 

*OLF: Cut between medium shots of RACHEL, FELIX, and the TOURISTS, cutting to film sequences as projected when appropriate.*   



RAUL
The first thing I fell in love with was your voice. 
It's the only thing I hear now when I close my eyes. 
You always wanted to take me to the ocean, 
and I always said us PINOY don't like to ocean swim. WE got sharks back home bigger than SHAQ. 'sides I'm from Long Beach- Santa Monica ain't nuthin'

*(FILM) Hand-held camera under the water's surface, a GoPro or an iPhone.* 

(FILM) The underwater camera pans to a man's feet. We see only his feet but catch glimpses of a gray sky as he walks to the shore. 

EXT. SIDEWALK

*(FILM) Various POV shots from a bike-mounted camera, a GoPro or an iPhone.*  

(FILM) The bustle of cars, people, city art, dogs, and fire hydrants. The image shudders to a static shot as the bike abruptly screeches its brakes. Sound of a car horn. 

RACHEL begins to breathe loudly again.

*(FILM) Stable, static shots, third person.* 

(FILM) We see the man we saw in previous  film. Raul is on his bike, he wears no helmet just his killer smile. We now see the entire landscape of his Long Beach turf. Colorful graffitied walls and an array of billboards cross by. 

(FILM) The man gets off his bike and walks to a bus stop. As he waits we see him slip his headphones on. 

RAUL
You told me you wanted to see the place I come from. 
I was proud and a little embarrassed. You're not like me. You were from another galaxy... And the metro bus don't go there. 

(FILM) The bus arrives; Raul puts his bike on the rack and enters the bus. The people on the bus are just as colorful as the street art. The man takes a window seat. POV shots - out the window as the <<Long Beach>> scenes shift like a viewmaster toy with childlike scenes of the city.

VARIOUS W.S. 

(FILM) Again: The bustle of cars, people, city art, dogs, and fire hydrants, with the music underneath, louder than before.  

Raul gets off and changes buses  perhaps he gets on the Metro chain to LA/westwood or Culver City The music shifts, changes and modulate to fit or contrast the  images we see him passing. The image shudders to a static shot as the bike abruptly screeches its brakes. Sound of a car horn and a thud. 

EDDIE kneels and scoops up RACHEL and she stirs.

*VQ #460 - Amongst bikes*

RACHEL

Put on your helmet  



	EDDIE

	 What?  

[SOUND CUE: Thunderclap. SOUND CUE: Gnossienne #1 by Seth Ford-Young.]

EDDIE is frozen in time, RACHEL stands. 

*VQ #465 - Bike POV*

She continues to mutter "put on your helmet" as she (1) examines the images projected on the wall (2) begins to dance (3) dance becomes frenetic and desperate. 

*VQ #470 - Bike sequence*

RACHEL

Put on your helmet.

RACHEL runs through Ritual 2B. When she returns, she collapses back into EDDIE'S arms. 

SOUND CUE: Thunderclap.

*VQ #475 - Selfie.*

(FILM) RAUL is running towards the camera from far away. Every time he gets close, it cuts to him  running  towards her but even further away. Rachel prays louder as RAUL gets further away. RACHEL finally runs towards his image and he stops in front of her. Eddie moves as if to protect her.

*OLF: CU of RACHEL.* 

RACHEL sees RAUL, there is a long moment.

RACHEL
You.



RAUL
Me.

*OLF: CU of RAUL*

RACHEL
Yo

RAUL
Tu

(LIVE SHADOW)
Where are we?

RACHEL
I don't know. I've been searching- traveling but I didn't know why... searching but I don't remember what for... it doesn't matter...

(LIVE SHADOW)
I was on my bike coming to see  you and-  

RACHEL
Wait!

 (LIVE SHADOW)
I have something to show you.

*VQ #476 - Bus.* 

(FILM) The 720 Metro bus heading  east.

RACHEL
No Wait. NOT YET!

*OLF: MWS of Rachel* 

RACHEL reaches for the shadow, fighting the image of the bus. She pulls at the screen and projections of the Bus, EDDIE sends her forward.

EDDIE
Rachel, he's not there

RACHEL
Let me go!


Pushing away from EDDIE  into the projection surface, she is trying to reach Raul's shadow behind it. 

*VQ #478 - Cross.*

RACHEL
He's still there, he's on that bus. He wont wear his helmet- it's too small, he bought it too small cuz' it was on sale

(LIVE SHADOW) 
You always wanted to see where I came from. I never got a chance to show it to you so I decided to make this and come bring it to you-

RACHEL
NO! I don't want to think about that. I don't want to remember that. I'm not ready. Not yet it's too soon. I don't want to remember! STOP!

*VQ #480 - Running.* 

RACHEL approaches and reaches out to RAUL, the CITIZENS grab her and she swoons and feints. EDDIE picks her up and carries her away. 

The video abruptly stops - BLACKOUT- The sound of a bus departing.

# RITUAL 2/B.1: “WHATS THE PROBLEM” (@ FELIX, SHEENA)

= In an  RA dorm room late night homework.

.RITUAL 2/B.1: "WHATS THE PROBLEM" (@ FELIX, SHEENA)

*OLF: Medium shot of TRAVELERS, cutting to various reactions of TOURISTS.*   

FELIX and SHEENA  walk down a long hallway of doors some are open, some partially shut, others closed. WE hear laughter, whispers, music- dorm hallways ambience. SHEENA and the Tourist crowd into a small room lit with a single light. Felix hangs back.

*VQ #520 - Math lecture.*

SHEENA
Felix you have to

FELIX starts to hyperventilate quietly

FELIX
I  don't I can't

Four grad students sitting huddled together in a corner with only a ratty sofa and a watermarked coffee table. Each is staring at some form of retina screen. Lamdas and thetas are flying in the air like fairies or witches. They are scraping through the night to meet a deadline in deep shit frantic and yet almost giggly exhaustion. It's the math version of the 3rd floor design lab.

MATT 
Did you get the curve? Did you run the script? Damnit this is wrong again. FUCK! What do your results say? 

NATALIE
Oh Gosh. Not again I told you please don't curse. 
I just started running the code! It's going to take at least another hour!! 

DAISY 
Forget about the code already! It's 11:07! We are less than one hour away from submission. Awwww Fuck it! I am just going to fabricate them. 

NATALIE
Buy guys, why are we here? To learn, not to make up stuff! 

DAISY 
You have Come here to invent things and that's what I am doing! 

MATT
Shit man! I cant deal with your reflective thinking again! Either fabricate and help us or shut the fuck up!.. uh sorry Natalie- or be quiet. 

DAISY

NATALIE

DAISY

NATALIE

MATT 
who is he?

DAISY 
oh man this game is so much fun.

MATT dances to FELIX. NATALIE picks up a small object from the floor. It is red in color. It is as few centimeters long. It has some powdery coating, and its greasy. Its porous.

*VQ #590 - Two videos.*

NATALIE 
This is beautiful. Who designed this?

MATT looks at it closely. He rotates it. He is staring at it. Its the color of the sun

MATT 
THIS IS COOOL!

NATALIE 
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

MATT
This is just like a kaleidoscope. I want to look into it.

Sheena turns to FELIX who starts to laugh. 

FELIX
They studied all day, they worked so hard. They got stoned ONCE and discovered Cheetos.

MATT
We should get more.

They all begin to look and call for FELIX.

DAISY

*VQ #615 - Speed up w/ Katy Perry.* 

NATALIE turns on the radio. "Firework" by Katy Perry plays.

NATALIE
HEY! Lets got to the Cat and the Fiddle.

DAISY
That closed 3 years ago. Lets go to IN-N-Out!

NATALIE
Yes please!  Don't curse.

MATT

FELIX looks at Sheena.

NATALIE
Watch out!

They stop suddenly and look out front. We  hear the same loud sound of tires, brakes and  a needle scratch we heard before.

BLACKOUT. 

*VQ #630 - Wavy chalk.*

She faints/sinks to the floor and FELIX catches her.

FELIX
(quietly) Hey girl... are you OK?

SHEENA
What happened to you guys!?

EDDIE
Some memory.... I guess. 
Some painful memory .. That was... I felt
... more like a ritual than a memory.

SHEENA
This was a mistake- I'm sorry Felix... that's what it felt like, a ritual mistake

FELIX
What did she see... what did you do?

The interior walls of the Agora disappear. 

*VQ #670 - Shadows of citizens.* 

The CITIZENS appear as shadows surrounding the Agora, via PRJ-AG*. They move quietly, carefully. Perhaps the CITIZENS' shadows bear more of a resemblance to the TRAVELERS than before.

Sheena-

PING! 

On the walls, projected signs appear. TOURIST names appear with their photos below.   

EDDIE
We were invited here.

SHEENA
Really?  I snuck in! (Gesturing at the TOURISTS.) THEY were invited here. Why are WE still here?  
 

EDDIE
I don't know. We were invited here, by something- or someone. I can feel it.

THE GUIDE
(to each TOURIST)
You don't have to remember. Let them do that. Invent, imagine, it's your memory now. You make up the story.  It's a two-way street.    

SHEENA ^
Feel it? What's wrong with you? Look at them. Are you stupid? Who cares what you feel- what about Rachel

EDDIE
What's wrong with you, why are you so angry?

SHEENA
Because someone or something is manipu- 
What the...

SHEENA yells at the unseen Citizen.

SHEENA
Hey YOU! YOU SCI-FI FREAKS!! What are we  - your private dancers?

CITIZEN 2
NO, we are you Archive.

SHEENA
FUCK! Hey You, lemme see your phone.... please! 

SHEENA takes a tourist's phone and examines it, reading the GUIDE text.

SHEENA
"It's your memory now. You make up the story." What the fuck is that?

CITIZEN
It's just a phone - their ticket's in there. Please, you were invited too. You signed up online for this...

SHEENA
Aw shuttup....  Here...sorry

SHEENA tosses the phone back to the tourist.

EDDIE
Jeeze. Sheena... Sorry man, you alright?
I hope she didn't scare you

FELIX
Sheena, please  stop cursing...

They all turn to look at him

FELIX
Please...

THE GUIDE
You're not the one being thrown around. I'm dizzy!

SHEENA
Shit I'm too.... sorry.
I'm leaving.

FELIX
What? After you dragged us-

RACHEL
I'm staying.

They all look at her, she stands slowly.

RACHEL
I gotta go back in.

FELIX
You gotta stay Sheena. I might need your help.

SHEENA
Why? This is crazy. I'm serious, it's dangerous IN here.
(SHE TURNS TO A TOURIST)
Look around you do you really know what we're doing here?  "What's the story?" what story? Ever since the - 

FELIX
It's ok Sheena, say it

SHEENA
Jesus Felix, ever since it happened. It's like Rachel's been living in a desert. But in here- it like a swamp of emotions and quicksand memories ready to drag you down. Why are we even in this place anyway?  

CITIZEN 2
Because you signed up online and were invited. (BEAT) Actually it's about Time and Space.

SHENNA
Right. Thanks, Stephen Hawking. What's that supposed to mean? Can you say something helpful and stop being so weird?

CITIZEN 1
This place is like the ocean.

SHEENA
What the hell does that even mean. This is bullshit. I came here, I was INVITED here to  help my friends. I was fine in my own little personal bubble of bullshit and technology, but something dragged me out here and for what? To stare at some bullshit memories I CAN'T REMEMBER, some wasteland of technology garbage? Hey. Hey all of you. Listen up and stop taking pictures... remember this - in your minds, not just on your phones- Somebody should fucking remember this

TOURIST
Like the ocean.

SHEENA
Ok.. And...

CITIZEN 2 ^
THIS PLACE IS LIKE THE OCEAN. IT'S LIKE A FRONTIER, AN EDGE ^

FELIX
It's beautiful and terrifying-

EDDIE
And so deep you can get lost

RACHEL
Like being in love.

CITIZEN 1
It's a place to come and remember. A place to share memories that remind us of who we are.

Either a VOICEOVER or a projection

Where we've been ... and where we are going.

CITIZEN 2
Sheena -- Can you feel the breeze? Look at the sky. 

THE GUIDE ^
I'm not sure this is allowed.  

Images are  projected everywhere, moving and static

CITIZEN 1
The sunset, the beach, your first grade teacher, your last memory

CITIZEN 2 ^
The 720 Metro bus, your mother, your first memory

*VQ #700 - Shadows fade, remix begins, citizens leave shadows.* 

The sun sets in the distance as the selected videos of <<Los Angeles>> appears. A harmonica riff on <<"Back in the USSR">> and voices in non-English languages are heard. 

RACHEL
Ok, I think I'm ready.

PING!

# TRANSITION : THE CITIZENS EMERGE.

.TRANSITION : THE CITIZENS EMERGE. 

*VQ #710 - Environment changes.*   

Something changes, The SPACE change- TIME changes- EVERYTHING changes. it might be huge or simple but everything is finally revealed. The revelation of technology is  presented simply and so is more beautiful and moving. Somehow the rules have changed so that the CITIZENS can join us  both in reenacting and observing as equals. CODE switches on EVERYWHERE

CITIZENS
We are never lost. 
We are your memories. 
We are here

*VQ #720 - Remix evolves.* 

In the Agora, THE ARCHIVE reiterates the Rituals according to the WATCHERS' votes.  - <<a man pedaling a bike, a polaroid memory, and a departure lounge appear>>.

# Act 3  

# SCENE 1: RITUAL OF STORYTELLING

= RACHEL and FELIX’s painful memories are at the center, but branches out to become and encompass all of their stories - fact and fiction, remixing themselves with media of both the previous and yet unseen rituals.

.SCENE 1: RITUAL OF STORYTELLING

There is only a single version of Ritual 3, for everyone.   

*OLF: Live feed shots to be determined.* 

*VQ #750 - Establish ritual in agora.* 

The CITIZENS enact records from within THE ARCHIVE. RACHEL and FELIX's painful memories are at the center, but they branch out to become and encompass all of their stories - fact and fiction, remixing themselves with media of both the previous and yet unseen rituals.

# RITUAL 3/A: “RAUL’S REVELATION”

= We and RACHEL finally get to see RAUL homemade video

.RITUAL 3/A:  "RAUL'S REVELATION"

*VQ #800 - Start ritual 3/A.*   

The Bike rider on the walls of the  UNDERPASS reappears. The Rider gets both closer and further  as it did in  Rachel's Primal memory. The memory gets closer and closer. It's RACHEL's boyfriend RAUL he rides up  and smiles his killer smile.

RAUL
The first thing I fell in love with was your voice. (projection : closeup of RACHEL's mouth)
It's the only thing I hear now when I close my eyes.  
You- me , Yo-Tu ( projection RAUL/RACHEL)
You always wanted to take me to the ocean, (projection)
You told me you wanted to see the place I come from. 
I was kinda proud and a little embarrassed. 
You're not like me. (projection : RACHEL's culture)
You always wanted to see where I came from. 
I never got a chance to show it to you, I was always too busy trying to make something happen. Getting my restaurant to take off.

So I decided one day to make this and come bring it to you. 

Rachel this is whom I am and where I come from.

Projections, reenactments, video, sound  a kaleidoscope of LONG BEACH and RAUL. It should be beautiful  but it the way of homemade, handheld videos- ALTHO one made by an ARTIST!

At the same time RAUL is SPEAKING to RACHEL another story begins nearby. The two RITUALS do not compete or conflict but rather symbiotically support and underline the other



===

# RITUAL 3/B: “DRIVING DAISY”

= Felix's   friends and their journey to  UCLA

.RITUAL 3/B: "DRIVING DAISY"

*VQ #900 - Start ritual 3/B.*   

A montage, a collage, an homage to  to the  culture of hard work and  comradeship in a  high level gradate school program. It starts again the sound of an airplane landing it, we hear the noise of the airplanes tires squeal upon landing. BACK IN THE USSR plays. Perhaps we  see TONY and TINA  kissing at LAX. NATALIE walks by with a  LARGE backpack and a rolling carryon. She looks down at her phone confused- maybe she bumps into Matt.  A line of  people walking for the FYL-AWAY back to Westwood. FELIX, NATALIE, MATT and Daisy are in line, they do not know each other. Perhaps we see  Daisy and Felix sitting next to each other on the bus but facing away.

Campus life, study groups. A football game NATALIE looks on confused. Video snippets of "MY WEEK AT GRAD SCHOOL" pop up at the same time on different screens. They talk about their journeys to LA. NATALIE and MATT seem nervous DAISY is radiant The four are studying together only Felix has a beer in his hand. WE see and hear the four grad students all over Westwood and LA. Perhaps we see FELIX's Asking "doesn't it EVER rain here?"

MATT
Are you guys  hungry? I'm hungry?

Interwoven through all this are  reenactments and memories we have seen earlier as well as images and memories upload by the Tourists and Watchers online. 

NATALIE
Staving.

Its a kaleidoscope of  college life in Westwood and LA. 

DAISY
You're always hungry

There is music and sound and lots of driving... 'cuz its LA!

NATALIE
HEY! Lets got to the Cat and the Fiddle

DAISY
That closed 3 years ago. Lets go to IN N Out!

Loud music about driving and weather reports. 

DAISY
13,12,11, 10, 9, 8 ,7, 6...SEND!

Rachel opens an umbrella it starts to rain

NATALIE
... gombate. SEND!

MATT ^
SEND!

The TRAVELERS (and TOURISTS, if they wish) weave a new story. They have the freedom of a past once completely known but is each time enacted anew.  

The WATCHERS, still "following" a TOURIST and A TRAVELER help influence media selection from THE ARCHIVE in a way that they believe will connect with their assigned TOURIST or TRAVELER. 

In addition to specifying media, the WATCHER'S choices generates text projected on the walls that represents their votes.   

DAISY
Wonderwoman uh uh I'm Wonderwoman

Video, sound, lighting are all brought to bear. The entire ARCHIVE is at the disposal of building a new story in the Agora.

NATALIE
Guys! Guys! Calm down. "For deadlines may come and deadlines may go, but well.. life does NOT go on forever." It's grad school! So Live it! Love it!

DAISY
Shut the fuck up!

MATTE ^
Shut the fuck it!

Music,  projections, the walls move and shift changing the space.

FELIX
They studied all day, they worked so hard. They got stoned ONCE. for  God's sake. They found my stash when I left.

The rain gets louder. NATALIE sings TANGERINE. Thunderclap!

NATALIE
IN N OUT!!!

MATT ^
IN N OUT!!

FELIX
WAIT! Not yet please...  let me just tell them I love them .. that I'm sorry I wasn't there.. And that's why I'm here!

RACHEL
Put on your helmet! It's gonna rain today. WAIT  let me say it , let me say it just one more time!

The music gets louder the rain storms down.NATALIE and MATT sing. RAUL laughs as he turn his face up to the sky. LIGHTING! THUNDERCLAP, A needle scratches an old album BLACKOUT!  We sit in the darkness as long as we can, there is only the sound of  RACHEL breathing , gasping loudly. FELIX whispering "I wasn't there" and a record skipping over and over.

RACHEL 
I Love you!! 
(long ass beat...)
Raul was so surprised that I love cauliflower,, toast, and tomato soup from a can. He laughs and I eat when I dream that we're still together, cooking and laughing. It's still perfect... in my dreams. The the spice, the heat, the sticky sweet bliss when we fell asleep together.

I know I need to fill the emptiness and get healthy enough to stop worrying about forgetting Raul- I need to go back to my life.
I don't wanna forget anything ... or anyone- like all of you.
(She asks Eddie)
Do you know? I want to feel ... full again

EDDIE
Music always fills me with memories. It's like the sound of water flowing, memories give us life. 
Running after the ice cream man. Saturday morning cartoons, my momma singing in the kitchen, the smell of bacon. I remember one day, my mom and I went down to the community pool on Rosecrans. She held my hand and it kinda embarrassed me, now I wish I could hold her again. Her name was (______)
(He tells  Sheena)
I remember the music of her laughter and her singing "I heard it thru the Grapevine."

SHEENA
My father, His name was(________) always smelled good. Like a working man. Like what guys used to smell like. Smoke, sweat... and Aqua Velva. 

Like..Like... a Memorial Day ball park frank on the grill at Griffith Park. Memories are like smoke they can disappear into thin air, but the smell, the memories will always stay in your hair and in your heart and all the water in the ocean can't wash it off- (Sheena smells her shirt)
(She talks to  Felix)
I'm kinda weird... I know it - and I think it's OK.

FELIX[[I STARTED BECOMING ANGRY AND THEN SOME GUYS SHOWED UP AND TOOK HER AWAY. SHE WANTED TO GO. SHE WAS HAPPY WITH THEM. 
My arm was broken and I couldn’t carry her...so I walked back to the beach and threw my deck into the Pacific]]
In high school I was a math nerd with a skate board. Then I met Daisy. She made me chill out and just relax and enjoy things. We would walk to the pier in our bare feet, the sand hot and then cooler as  we neared the water. Daisy always said that salt water was cleansing. Like tears, like the ocean- tears can just swallow us whole- all our memories and it cleanses us.

One Sunday afternoon in Venice Beach, we walked the canals and I held her hand... with my skateboard in the other. We were barefoot. The sand stuck to our bodies, like our memories and even the ocean can't wash those away.  They're with me forever ...like you all. I'm grateful

SHEENA

I'm grateful  

FELIX

Thank you  

EDDIE

I'm grateful  

RACHEL

RAUL
The year before I met RACHEL, I heard an Architects give a TED talk.. 

<<Images of <<Los Angeles>>, 2015. Images of the TOURISTS, TRAVELERS entering the Lobby.  Images of the CITIZENS and the WATCHERS.>>

ARCHITECT
Bertolt Brecht once said radio was one directional when it should have been two. We should have changed its function from distribution to communication. 

<<Images of advertising in <<Los Angeles>> in the 1920s.  Images from within the Rituals of this and other performances.>>

ARCHITECT 
That the radio would be the finest possible communication apparatus in public life, a vast network of pipes. 
It was 1926! 

ARCHITECT
If it knew how to receive as well as transmit, how to let the listener speak as well as hear, it could bring people relationships instead of isolating them.

<<Images from Ritual 3, along with its source material.>>

CITIZENS 1 & 2
