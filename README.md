# fountainhead

This is a parser for Fountain-formatted scripts that will output "active documents" that incorporate dynamic, code-based elements and are also used for control of the show.  Let's talk this week about your thoughts about this, after you can do some research.  The attached script "LosAtlantisPlay01-18(jb)" is an example of the type of document that eventually we'll put in Fountain format and run through this parser.  The resulting output is what will provide the "Control/Cueing Web Interface" shown in the diagram attached. 

This work is based on the obj-c fountain parser: https://github.com/nyousefi/Fountain
